It's been a while since the original announcement in April, but WhatsApp's Communities are now live.

Well, sort of.

In a blog post, the company said that Communities are starting to roll out on WhatsApp globally, but they will be available to everyone "over the next few months" (I've checked my WhatsApp apps and I don't yet see the feature).

Communities are super-groups which can unite multiple groups and users over one topic. WhatsApp suggests that the feature would work best for neighborhoods, parents at a school, and workplaces.

If you did get the feature in your WhatsApp, you'll see a new "Communities" tab on top (on Android) or at the bottom (on iOS). You can then start a new Community or add existing groups to a Community you've previously created.

WhatsApp points out that Communities are protected by end-to-end encryption, which is not the case with Slack and Discord, for example.

WhatsApp also recently added a few new unrelated features, including the ability to create polls. Groups have also been expanded to accommodate as many as 1,024 users, and video calls can now host 32 people.

If you're anything like me, you spend a little too much time reading about who owns what social media app, and games like Quordle are your escape. So it's a drag when it's too hard. This is supposed to be fun!

If Quordle is a little too challenging today, you've come to the right place for hints. There aren't just hints here, but the whole Quordle solution. Scroll to the bottom of this page, and there it is. But are you sure you need all four answers? Maybe you just need a strategy guide. Either way, scroll down, and you'll get what you need.

What is Quordle?

Quordle is a five-letter word guessing game similar to Wordle, except each guess applies letters to four words at the same time. You get nine guesses instead of six to correctly guess all four words. It looks like playing four Wordle games at the same time, and that is essentially what it is. But it's not nearly as intimidating as it sounds.

Is Quordle harder than Wordle?

Yes, though not diabolically so.

Where did Quordle come from?

Amid the Wordle boom of late 2021 and early 2022, when everyone was learning to love free, in-browser, once-a-day word guessing games, creator Freddie Meyer says he took inspiration from one of the first big Wordle variations, Dordle — the one where you essentially play two Wordles at once. He took things up a notch, and released Quordle on January 30. Meyer's creation was covered in The Guardian six days later, and now, according to Meyer, it attracts millions of daily users. Today, Meyer earns modest revenue from Patreon, where dedicated Quordle fans can donate to keep their favorite puzzle game running.

How is Quordle pronounced?

“Kwordle.” It should rhyme with “Wordle,” and definitely should not be pronounced exactly like "curdle.”

Is Quordle strategy different from Wordle?

Yes and no.

Your starting strategy should be the same as with Wordle. In fact, if you have a favorite Wordle opening word, there’s no reason to change that here. We suggest something rich in vowels, featuring common letters like C, R, and N. But you do you.

After your first guess, however, you’ll notice things getting out of control if you play Quordle exactly like Wordle.

What should I do in Quordle that I don’t do in Wordle?

Solving a Wordle puzzle can famously come down to a series of single letter-change variations. If you’ve narrowed it down to “-IGHT,” you could guess “MIGHT” “NIGHT” “LIGHT” and “SIGHT” and one of those will probably be the solution — though this is also a famous way to end up losing in Wordle, particularly if you play on “hard mode.” In Quordle, however, this sort of single-letter winnowing is a deadly trap, and it hints at the important strategic difference between Wordle and Quordle: In Quordle, you can't afford to waste guesses unless you're eliminating as many letters as possible at all times.

Guessing a completely random word that you already know isn't the solution, just to eliminate three or four possible letters you haven’t tried yet, is thought of as a desperate, latch-ditch move in Wordle. In Quordle, however, it's a normal part of the player's strategic toolset.

Is there a way to get the answer faster?

In my experience Quordle can be a slow game, sometimes dragging out longer than it would take to play Wordle four times. But a sort of blunt-force guessing approach can speed things up. The following strategy also works with Wordle if you only want the solution, and don’t care about having the fewest possible guesses:

Try starting with a series of words that puts all the vowels (including Y) on the board, along with some other common letters. We've had good luck with the three words: “NOTES,” “ACRID,” and “LUMPY.” YouTuber DougMansLand suggests four words: “CANOE,” “SKIRT,” “PLUMB,” and “FUDGY.”

Most of the alphabet is now eliminated, and you’ll only have the ability to make one or two wrong guesses if you use this strategy. But in most cases you’ll have all the information you need to guess the remaining words without any wrong guesses.

If strategy isn't helping, and you're still stumped, here are some hints:

Are there any double or triple letters in today’s Quordle words?

Two words have letters that occur twice.

Are any rare letters being used in today’s Quordle like Q or Z?

The last letter of the alphabet slipped in there.

What do today’s Quordle words start with?

U, L, F, and A.

What are the answers for today’s Quordle?

Are you sure you want to know?

There’s still time to turn back.

OK, you asked for it. The answers are:

Friday isn't here quite yet, but a new Wordle is! If you get stuck, we're here to help with handy hints, as we are every day.

If you just want today's word, you can jump straight to the end of this article for November 3's Wordle solution, for puzzle #502. If you'd rather work through it yourself, keep reading for some tips, tricks, and clues.

Where did Wordle come from?

Wordle was initially created by engineer Josh Wardle as a gift for his partner, though it quickly spread until it became an international phenomenon. Thousands of players across the globe tackle Wordle each day, with some fans even having created alternate versions of the daily word puzzle game. These include battle royale format Squabble, music identification game Heardle, and variations like Dordle and Quordle that make you guess multiple words at once.

The popularity of Wordle even reached such heights that the New York Times bought it earlier this year, while TikTok creators live-stream themselves playing it.

What's the best Wordle starting word?

The goal of Wordle is to have fun, and there's no right way to have fun. Just choose whatever starting word feels right to you, and don't let anyone shame you for it. However, if you want to take a more strategic approach, we have a few ideas to help you pick a word that will spark joy. One tip is to select a word that includes at least two different vowels, plus some common consonants like S, T, R, or N.

What happened to the Wordle archive?

The entire archive of past Wordles used to be available for anyone to play in glorious days gone by. Unfortunately it has since been taken down, with the website's creator stating it was done at the request of the New York Times.

Is Wordle getting harder?

If you're finding Wordle too easy, you can try enabling its Hard Mode to give your brain a tougher challenge. But Wordle isn't getting any harder by itself — it's the same difficulty that it's always been.

Why are there two different Wordle answers some days?

Wordle is a fun, collective experience specifically because everyone's solving for the same word every day. Occasionally, though, Wordle has accepted two different solutions as correct on the same day. This is because the New York Times made changes to the Wordle word list after acquiring it, and sometimes swaps out words from the original list. To ensure you're getting the right answer every day, refresh your browser before you play — the site will save your streak.

Here's a subtle hint for today's Wordle answer:

It's an adjective about sound.

Does today's Wordle answer have a double letter?

Not today!

Today's Wordle is a 5-letter word that starts with...

The letter... A.

What's the answer to Wordle today?

Elon Musk, the newly self-crowned chief twit, seems to have lots of ideas to wring every last red cent out of Twitter users. My dude is turning Twitter into the Spirit Airlines of social media platforms.

Musk seems poised to crack open users' wallets at every turn, or at least make the attempt. Some of his ideas seem...farfetched, let's say. The very online billionaire floats ideas on a whim. His very purchase of Twitter, and the underlying will-he-won't-he-what's-next saga is indicative of that.

I wrote last week, as Musk courted advertisers right after he purchased Twitter, that he was running into the realities that come with actually owning his favorite social platform. It's like a dude who loves partying that buys a bar and then realizes he signed up to clean all day, deal with drunks, and make razor thin profits, at best.

Musk seems to have realized that Twitter struggles to make money, and now that's his burden. It's no longer an ~*EpiC JoKe~* he can post about but not have to concern himself with. It's his reality. In other words, Musk is quickly rising up the y-axis on the fuck around/find out chart.

So now he's floating monetization scheme after monetization scheme, which we decided to rank on a completely useless scale of likely/less likely/pipe dream/late night toilet tweet. And, to be clear, I am operating with no inside knowledge, I do not have an MBA, and Musk is the kind of guy who will...do anything. So make of this what you will.

Courting advertisers: Likely

OK, I'm cheating by starting with this one. It isn't really a monetization scheme, but it is literally how Twitter makes almost all of its revenue. So Elon kowtowing to advertisers is really the monetization scheme. If he wants to keep the platform alive, then he has to keep advertisers happy.

$20 for verification: Pipe Dream

Elon Musk, the richest man alive, really wanted to charge folks $20 per month — $240 per year — for verification through Twitter Blue. The internet quickly and swiftly told him to pound sand. It ain't happening...at least not for that price.

That's more than HBO Max, Netflix, freakin' anything to which you subscribe. This won't happen because you'd have to be an extreme dingus to pay that much for a stupid little blue check.

...OK FINE, $8 for verification: Less likely

Perhaps because acclaimed author Stephen King got pissed, Musk lowered his Twitter Blue/verification price-tag to $8 per month. In my humble opinion, that is still eight bucks too many for a blue check, but Musk does seem committed to the idea. He tweeted that the $8 Blue subscription would come with verification, priority in replies, and other features.

He hasn't backed off the idea, and continues to post about it. He seems to think it'll help Twitter make money and somehow also discourage bots and spammers. I'm not so sure it'll do either of those things, but that doesn't mean Musk won't do it.

So yeah, maybe a blue check will cost $8 per month in the future. I suspect lots of folks, like myself, will just...hand over the verification. First, because it's a dumb thing to pay for, and second, because you'd have to be a total dweeb to pay for verification. Musk seems to fundamentally misunderstand verification — it absolutely does not make you cool or a "lord." And paying for it would be the online equivalent of just asking to get shoved into a locker in high school.

Anyway, he still might do it.

Paywalling video: Less likely

This is a tough one. It's not definitely happening but it seems possible.

The Washington Post reported, citing an internal email, that Musk's Twitter is pushing to roll out a feature called "Paywalled Video." It's considered high-risk internally, however, especially since it's a feature likely to be used for adult content.

Essentially users could post paywalled video, Stripe would process the payment, and Twitter would take a cut.

It might not happen if it's deemed too risky, but reporting suggests this one is actually in the works.

Zombie Vine: Pipe dream

So Musk has floated bringing back the beloved short-form video app previously owned and ran by Twitter. He even publicly asked famous YouTuber Mr. Beast for advice. It's not really a monetization scheme — at least not as obvious as charging for a blue check — but it would obviously be aimed at making money. After all, Musk seems dead-set on charging for everything that's "free."

Mashable's Christianna Silva did a great job explaining, in detail, why it's a bad idea to bring Vine back. In short: The creators who defined it have aged and moved on. Also TikTok exists. There's no community to offer with Vine, which is what made it beloved in the first place.

Musk would surely run into obstacles trying to bring Vine back in any real way. When it was reported that Musk had Twitter engineers dig into Vine's code, a former employee dished out some reality.

"This code is 6+ years old. Some of it is 10+," Sara Beykpour wrote on Twitter. "You don't want to look there. If you want to revive Vine, you should start over."

That sounds like a headache. A headache that won't happen.

Charging for complaints: Late night toilet tweet

Knowing his ideas aren't all that popular in at least some circles, Musk tweeted: "To all complainers, please continue complaining, but it will cost $8."

To be clear, this is a joke.

But hey, we needed at least one "late night toilet tweet." And it's indicative of how Musk operates. He's shitposting his way through running Twitter.

All creators on Facebook can now use Meta's professional mode to make some extra cash.

Meta announced the global expansion of professional mode on Monday, Oct. 31, a product it began testing with select creators nearly a year ago, in December 2021. Now, anyone can use it.

This comes at a time in which Meta appears to be doubling down in its investment in its creator user base — by the end of 2022 it plans to "invest over $1 billion in programs that give creators new ways to earn money for the content they create on Facebook and Instagram." The company might be looking for loyalty as it sets its sights on the metaverse, which is in dire need of creator support .

What is professional mode?

Professional mode is, in its most basic sense, a page for individual creators. It's similar to making your Instagram account a professional one instead of a personal or business account.

"If you would like to build a public presence to represent your personal brand using your Facebook profile where you connect with friends and family, professional mode is the way to go," Facebook wrote in a blog post . "If you would like to create a public presence for a business, product or for yourself that’s separate from your personal profile, we suggest you create a Page."

Professional mode on Facebook is designed for creators to maintain their personal page while also building a public presence on the app. In line with Pages, this allows creators the ability to build their presence on Facebook with a separate profile. Once you turn professional mode on, you can use more monetization and analytics tools.

How to set up professional mode on Facebook

Setting up professional mode is pretty simple. Start off by heading to your Facebook profile.

Click the three dots next to "Edit profile." This is the menu for your profile. You'll be faced with a punch of profile setting options. Below "memorialization settings" but above "create another profile," you'll see "Turn on professional mode." Confirm by tapping "Turn on" and voila!

It's only been five days since Elon Musk took over Twitter, and conservative users are already turning on him.

He's even lost Catturd.

If you'll recall all the way back to...Friday, Musk's first day as Twitter's new owner, the self-proclaimed "Chief Twit" decided to lay out his priorities on his feed for all to see: He spent the day replying to right-wing Twitter users and offering to look into their menial complaints. In fact, Musk's very first reply as Twitter owner was to an anonymous conservative influencer named @catturd2 who was personally whining about losing followers and not getting enough retweets on their posts. The billionaire promised to look into it.

To conservatives, Musk's Twitter takeover was a big victory. They cheered him on as seemingly everyone else complained about Musk's ideas for the platform.

Fast forward just a few days, and he's already drawn their ire. Why? Because Musk tweeted that he talked with leaders of groups like the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) and the NAACP.

Then he followed that tweet up with a statement that his plan for a content moderation board will include "the civil rights community and groups who face hate-fueled violence."

Conservatives quickly filled Musk's Twitter mentions.

"I admit when I'm wrong and I was 100% wrong about @elonmusk changing Twitter," tweeted @catturd2, who just last week was singing Musk's praises. "The new Twitter moderation council is just a bunch of far left fanatic groups who were never targeted here. No average Joes, no real Conservatives, no one to represent the PEOPLE ACTUALLY TARGETED!"

"The bird is not free at all," complained one conservative user.

"Meet the new boss, same as the old boss," posted another.

This series of events wasn't too surprising, really. Nilay Patel of The Verge laid out how this was going to go on Friday. It was always going to be impossible to satiate the demands of conservative Twitter users while also providing a non-toxic environment for the masses. Musk could never give them what they want and also make Twitter a place that's advertiser-friendly.

Musk acquired Twitter under the pretense of creating a "free speech" platform. Clearly a lot of conservative Twitter users took that to mean anything goes. Case in point, on the very day Musk took over, researchers found that usage of the n-word on the platform increased by 500 percent. Twitter said it addressed the issue, claiming to find a short-term surge coming from 1,500 accounts that the company then suspended. However, an independent researcher, Travis Brown, disputed those numbers. Brown says Twitter actually suspended more than 16,000 accounts that day and the median age of the accounts runs contrary to what Twitter claims.

Musk is already reaping what he sowed. Even if he somehow successfully moves Twitter to a paid subscription-model , users won't want to pay for access to a place that's toxic. He can't let garbage accounts run amok tweeting nonstop slurs at the platform's users. Yet, if he bans them, right-wing influencers like Catturd will complain that his follower count dropped and start a campaign about how Musk is kowtowing to the "woke mob."

Have fun, Elon.
It's only been five days since Elon Musk took over Twitter, and conservative users are already turning on him.

He's even lost Catturd.

If you'll recall all the way back to...Friday, Musk's first day as Twitter's new owner, the self-proclaimed "Chief Twit" decided to lay out his priorities on his feed for all to see: He spent the day replying to right-wing Twitter users and offering to look into their menial complaints. In fact, Musk's very first reply as Twitter owner was to an anonymous conservative influencer named @catturd2 who was personally whining about losing followers and not getting enough retweets on their posts. The billionaire promised to look into it.

To conservatives, Musk's Twitter takeover was a big victory. They cheered him on as seemingly everyone else complained about Musk's ideas for the platform.

Fast forward just a few days, and he's already drawn their ire. Why? Because Musk tweeted that he talked with leaders of groups like the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) and the NAACP.

Then he followed that tweet up with a statement that his plan for a content moderation board will include "the civil rights community and groups who face hate-fueled violence."

Conservatives quickly filled Musk's Twitter mentions.

"I admit when I'm wrong and I was 100% wrong about @elonmusk changing Twitter," tweeted @catturd2, who just last week was singing Musk's praises. "The new Twitter moderation council is just a bunch of far left fanatic groups who were never targeted here.

We featured this mopping vacuum just a week ago when it was on sale at an affordable $344.99. As of Nov. 2, however, it's on sale for even less at just $319.99 — that's $180 in savings. This powerful wet-dry vac is a great addition to homes with lots of hard flooring or tile, as well as homes with pets or messy kiddos. Mashable culture editor Brian Koerber said "the Crosswave X7 actually delivers on its promise" to combine vacuuming and mopping into a single step.

Why we like it

Though it was released in 2020, the M1 MacBook Air is by no means outdated. Its M1 chip can power everyday tasks or more complex tasks like photo and video editing like a champ. It has an 18-hour battery life, ultra-portable design, and is completely fanless (so it won't sound like it's going to blast off when you're multitasking). It earned the Mashable Choice badge of honor for a reason. At $200 off, this deal at Best Buy knocks it down to its lowest price ever. At the time of writing, it's $100 more at Amazon.

Having your identity stolen is very real, and unfortunately a very common reality in the modern world. It’s difficult to live your life online without revealing personal information somewhere down the line. Social media, online shopping, and even paying your bills will put information such as your name, email address, phone number, address, or more online, somewhere.

If that personal info finds itself in the wrong hands, the results can be devastating. Your accounts can be accessed, credit cards compromised, or purchases made in your name. There are plenty of horror stories out there of identity thieves going as far as even making such outlandish purchases like property or luxury cars. If a cyber criminal gains access to your identity, you can be sure they will move as quickly as possible, and do as much financial damage as possible.

Most of us are vaguely aware of the dangers of online identity theft, or perhaps are unfortunate enough to have experienced it sometime in the past. Most people however, aren’t fully aware of just how easy it can be for bad actors to do some serious damage in the event of a targeted attack. Luckily though, if you’re willing to invest a bit of money for some peace of mind, it can be easy to protect yourself from identity theft online with NortonLifeLock’s latest product: Norton Identity Advisor Plus.

What is Norton Identity Advisor Plus?

Norton Identity Advisor Plus from NortonLifeLock is a targeted Identity Theft Protection product, separate from its typical antivirus offerings. It attempts to cover every step of the possible identity theft pipeline, from monitoring the dark web and social media sites for suspicious activity or leaked personal data, to identity restoration support with a qualified specialist, and even identity theft insurance. These services can be accessed via web browsers for PC and Mac, as well as with iOS or Android mobile apps.

What is identity restoration support?

Identity Restoration Support helpline is available 9am-6pm GMT (Mon-Fri), where a dedicated specialist will help guide you through the restoration process from start to finish. You’ll have a single specialist covering your case, and there are support services for a range of scenarios including stolen wallet assistance, which can help you replace credit cards, bank cards, your driver’s licence and other essential cards.

Norton Identity Advisor Plus also includes Identity Theft Insurance Coverage, which provides coverage of up to A$58,000 for covered expenses and specific losses related to identity theft, including financial loss and legal fees.

How much does Norton Identity Advisor Plus cost in Australia?

For a one-year subscription of Norton Identity Advisor Plus, you’ll be looking at A$119.99, billed annually. As an introductory offer, Norton is offering A$20 off your first year, making new sign-ups cost just A$99.99 / first year. A Norton Identity Advisor Plus licence is for one account, though the app and website are accessible on unlimited devices.

If your personal data is already floating out there in shady corners of the web (in which case you’ve got a few things to worry about), the appeal of Norton Identity Advisor Plus is mostly as a form of insurance - as well as literal financial support with insurance.

Is Norton Identity Advisor Plus a standalone product?

As a brand new, and relatively unique service, Norton Identity Advisor Plus is a completely standalone product. As such, it does not come as a part of Norton’s existing security products such as Norton 360 or Norton Antivirus Plus.

Keep your identity safe

There are so many ways, both online and in your day-to-day life where your personal information is at risk. Even the biggest, most secure companies can have data breaches that compromise sensitive information. Thieves can intercept your mail, sort through your garbage to find bills or receipts, or skim your card at ATMs and in-store card readers. With that information, there is no telling what kind of damage can be done.



In this world, a service such as Norton Identity Advisor Plus makes sense. Even if you don’t think you’d necessarily need a third party support agent in case of a missing wallet or compromised password, the monitoring component alone is incredibly useful. The included insurance coverage is a particularly interesting component of the service, which demonstrates Norton’s confidence in this product, and will likely drive a lot of consumer interest, too. For more information about what that looks like, or to even try out a free trial and scan for your own personal data, check out the Norton website here.

If you Google at-home vaginal microbiome tests, you'll be met with seemingly endless options, some from the drugstore and others with chic millennial branding. They seem to be having a moment, with more and more tests popping up on the market similar to at-home STI testing.

But what are vaginal biome tests for, and do we need these at-home tests? We asked gynecological experts to find out.

What are vaginal microbiome tests?

The vaginal microbiome, or vaginal flora, is a complex ecosystem of bacteria that's unique to each person, said Monte Swarup, MD, FACOG (Fellow of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists), board-certified in OB/GYN and founder of supplement company HPD Rx .

Vaginal microbiome tests determine whether you have infections like bacterial vaginosis (BV), trichomoniasis, vulvovaginal candidiasis (aka yeast infections), or other issues, Swarup said. Changes in the microbiome are due to age and hormonal disruptions, and by examining the vaginal microbiome you can determine if those disruptions are causing a problem.

"The vaginal microbiome plays a key role in genital tract infections that can lead to pain, decrease in quality of life, sexual dysfunction, and low body image," said gynecologist Kyler Silver, MD, assistant professor in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, UT Southwestern Medical Center.

According to Swarup, 75 percent of people with vaginas will experience an episode of conditions like BV, trichomoniasis, or vulvovaginal candidiasis at least once in their life.

Both Swarup and Silver said that vaginal microbiome tests are performed in their respective practices.

"Our clinics at UT Southwestern Medical Center perform a number of tests for both infections and normal vaginal flora," Silver explained. "These tests are quality assured for accuracy and reproducibility."

Do we need at-home vaginal microbiome tests?

Currently, there's no support by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) for the use of these at-home tests, Silver said, as they aren't evidence-based nor do they have a clear post-test treatment course. ACOG confirmed to Mashable that there's no clinical evidence to support their use.

"We recommend that women reach out to their health provider to discuss concerns about their vaginal microbiome regulation," Silver advised.

Swarup concurred, saying that testing the vaginal microbiome requires expertise of a qualified healthcare practitioner. Not only do patients benefit from expert guidance to properly administer the test and interpret the results, but they'll also know the best course for treatment.

While it may seem like the easier option, forego the chic-branded home test and go to the doctor's office.

The next generation of console virtual reality finally has a price tag and a release date.

Sony lifted the veil off that PlayStation VR 2 info on Wednesday. In a PlayStation Blog post , the company confirmed that you’ll be able to pick up a PSVR2 on Feb. 22 for the not insignificant price of $550 in the U.S. You can pre-order PSVR2 from the PlayStation Direct website starting on Nov. 15 and you can register for pre-orders (AKA pre-order your pre-order) starting Wednesday.

Yes, that is $50 more than the PlayStation 5 console itself, which is a requirement to play PSVR2.

SEE ALSO: You might need to buy headphones to get the most out of PlayStation VR2

But, such is the price of high-quality VR, and PSVR2 promises to provide that, at least. Its OLED screens run at 2000x2040 resolution per each eye and this time around the new headset has eye tracking. There’s also haptic feedback (read: rumble) in the headset itself and in the PSVR2 Sense controllers, similar to what the PS5’s DualSense controller can do.

That $550 gets you a headset, the controllers, and unspecified “stereo headphones,” per Sony’s blog post. That last bit is important because one thing the headset lacks is a built-in audio output source. There’s a headphone jack on the device, but no speakers like what the Meta Quest 2 has. Sony is also selling a $600 bundle that includes all of the above and the game Horizon: Call of the Mountain.

Speaking of games, Sony also revealed 11 new upcoming PSVR2 games to go along with the price announcement. These include Switchback, a new entry in the Dark Pictures horror anthology series, a collection of the Jurassic World Aftermath games, and an enhanced version of the popular city-builder Cities VR.

The full list is as follows:

The Dark Pictures: Switchback VR

Crossfire: Sierra Squad

The Light Brigade

Cities VR: Enhanced Edition

Cosmonious High

Hello Neighbor: Search and Rescue

Jurassic World Aftermath Collection

Pistol Whip VR

Zenith: The Last City

After the Fall

Tentacular

So, there you have it. PSVR2 is expensive, unsurprisingly, but at least it comes with headphones to alleviate the audio problem. Pricey or not, it should have plenty of technical advantages over something cheaper like the Quest 2, especially since it requires the horsepower of a PS5 to function. You’ll be able to see those benefits starting in February.

Elon Musk, Twitter's new owner, is tweeting out new ideas on what to do with the social network every day (sometimes it seems like every hour), with little evidence as to what's actually getting implemented.

According to a new report by The Washington Post, however, at least one new major feature is coming soon, though it's unclear whether Musk came up with it.

An internal email viewed by the outlet describes a new feature that would allow users to post videos and put them behind a paywall. The feature is internally called "Paywalled Video," and it might go out in a week or two, pending a "brief internal review." The report says that Twitter appears to be trying to rush the feature out, though it's unclear whether it was Musk's idea or it was conceived before Musk came on board as owner and CEO.

The email describes the feature in a fail amount of detail. It would allow a tweet's creator to enable a paywall once they add a video to the tweet, and choose from one of the preset prices, such as $1, $2, $5, or $10. To another user, the video would appear obscured, and would only be available for viewing after they've paid the requested amount. The creator of the video would receive the money via Stripe, and Twitter would take a cut, though there's no word on how big. Users who choose not to pay for the video would still be able to like or retweet the tweet.

The first thing that comes to mind with a feature like this is pornography, and The Washington Post spoke to an unnamed Twitter employee who said it seemed like something that would at least partially be used for adult content. A recent report by Reuters said that as much as 13 percent of content on Twitter is NSFW (not safe for work).

The email describes the feature as "high risk," and mentions “risks related to copyrighted content, creator/user trust issues, and legal compliance.”

The Washington Post says Twitter declined to comment on the story. Musk, who has been very vocal about all the stuff he wants to change at Twitter, didn't mention this feature by name, but he did recently say the company wants to "reward content creators."

Featured Video For You Revisiting the website that shaped the internet

Paywalled video is just one of many features that are possibly coming to Twitter following Musk's $44 billion acquisition of the service. Among other ideas, Musk recently tweeted about bringing back Twitter's long-abandoned video sharing service Vine, extending the allowed length of videos on the platform, and removing Twitter's character limit. Most recently, Musk said that Twitter's paid tier, called Twitter Blue, will get a price hike to $8 per month, and that it will include the ability to get a blue checkmark, which has so far been used to verify a user's real-life identity on the platform.

Among other ideas, Musk recently tweeted about bringing back Twitter's long-abandoned video sharing service Vine, extending the allowed length of videos on the platform, and removing Twitter's character limit. Most recently, Musk said that Twitter's paid tier, called Twitter Blue, will get a price hike to $8 per month, and that it will include the ability to get a blue checkmark, which has so far been used to verify a user's real-life identity on the platform.
Twitter has always been a bit of a dumpster fire, but over the past week it's evolved into something that pretty much defies metaphors.

It started when Elon Musk's reluctant takeover became official, then quickly escalated as he fired top executives, announced the introduction of an $8 monthly fee for Twitter Blue (which includes the blue tick), and generally made a lot of people quite angry.

Now, with layoffs looming, people have taken to trolling Musk's Twitter with a new meme format. Here's a recent example from climate scientist David Ho, whose tweet now has thousands of shares.

"Twitter laid me off today," wrote Ho. "If you know of any open positions for project managers or senior software engineers, let me know. I was in charge of the feature that made sure every time you tweeted about climate change you were served a fossil fuel ad."

Ho even followed the tweet up with some receipts.

Ho isn't the first person to use this format, which pokes fun at the things people find frustrating about the platform. It's been around for a few days now, and has slowly been picking up more and more steam.

Will any of the issues touched on in these memes be tackled by Musk? Only time will tell, but for the moment it least it seems like his priorities lie elsewhere.

Kids, parents, and Google Assistant users near and far now have access to a childhood-adapted virtual assistant experience, as Google launches new Google Assistant tools.

The latest virtual assistant update, released on Nov. 2, includes safety features and customization updates that seek to make using family devices a more accessible, child-friendly resource. A range of new choices, including kid-directed responses and voices meant to mimic the educational and emotive voice of a teacher or friendly adult, make the digital Assistant experience more attuned to its users than ever before.

Payam Shodjai, director of product management for Google Assistant, explained that the customizations aren't just for parents to better oversee their children's device use, but actually part of a larger goal to create a more natural, voice-forward helper that's accessible to all users, even kids. "We have about 700 million people that turn to Assistant every month to get things done across the world in many different countries and languages," he said. "When we look ahead, we envision an Assistant that is even more intelligent and personalized, that is more proactive, and that is also inclusive to everyone."

Kid-friendly updates like these, which will work across all devices once activated in your Google account settings, embrace the use of tech as an at-home resource for families and offer smarter ways to use Google's resources.

New account-specific parental controls

Users must modify their existing Assistant profile settings to access the new features — make sure your child's voice has been added to your Family Link account . Then, using the Google Home, Family Link, and Google Assistant apps on Android and iOS, users can modify the profile's media settings, enable or disable certain Assistant functions, and even establish Assistant downtime for child accounts.

Account holders can pre-select various music and video providers, like YouTube Kids, YouTube, and YouTube Music, to regulate their child's content access. Adults can also choose to allow their children access to news channels and podcasts. Parents have the option of choosing what kind of answers Assistant provides.

Basic Assistant functions, such as making phone calls, can be restricted on child profiles, and the update now lets account holders set Google Assistant downtime, just like on personal Android devices and Chromebooks.

To adjust these controls or block off usage time, go to Google Assistant settings, navigate to parental controls, and adjust to what works best for your family.

Kid-friendly Google Assistant voices

"Today, kids are growing up with technology rather than into technology, like my generation or my parents' generation," Shodjai explained. "With that in mind, it's important for us to approach kids' interactions with assistants in a very thoughtful and very responsible manner."

Part of this involved designing a wider range of what Google calls "demographically diverse" voices for Google Assistant itself. This resulted in four new Assistant voices meant to acknowledge a range of genders and regional inflections (although each still uses standard English), based on responses from surveyed parents and children.

The four new voices are referred to as Explore, Rio, Cosmic, and Breeze. Credit: Google

The four new voices were chosen from a casting call of more than 300 voice actors, Shodjai told Mashable. "They're supposed to be like a favorite teacher, or good friend. They speak in a bit of a slower and more expressive style, which helps with storytelling but also helps with comprehension," Shodjai said. Each voice also uses unique words and phrasing to convey the same answer to inquisitive kids.

To activate the new voices, simply have your child ask Google to change its voice.

Google's kid-friendly dictionary

Google Assistant will also introduce a new dictionary of words, phrases, and definitions that will be automatically used for child profiles. When Google Assistant detects your child's voice asking a question, it will offer simplified and age-appropriate answers different from the standard (often dry and technical) adult responses.

To build this feature, Google worked with partners and various sources that specialize in creating age-appropriate dictionary answers. From this baseline, Google tested the feature with parents and kids of different ages, noting the responses that resonated the most with families.

The new update works across speakers, smart displays, and mobile devices.

The "Final Girl," the last heroine standing at the conclusion of the horror/slasher film, is arguably one of the most exciting tropes horror movies have to offer.

In Carol J. Clover's Men, Women, and Chainsaws, which featured her now-famous theory of the Final Girl, she explained that horror films often exhibit a favoritism to the 'innocent' women that sit as the antithesis to her promiscuous peers. Those that participated in acts of sex, drug use, or "immoral" behavior died in horrific manners while the lone innocent had the privilege to make it to the end of the film.

From these women's independence and strength to their cultural power as scream queens, their sway over the industry is undeniable. And, due to decades of different directors, actors, and productions toying with the trope, the bounds of what a final girl should be have transformed tremendously, opening doors for more unique and outstanding performances.

From best bloodcurdling scream to best dressed, all the best final girls star in moments that have redefined the trope again and again.

Sally Hardesty (Marilyn Burns), Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974)

Best "epic ending"/ maniacal laugh

In the breathtaking final scenes of Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Sally Hardesty’s pick-up truck shot scene takes the cake and becomes a famous reference in horror history. After escaping from Leatherface and his sinister family’s slasher attempts, Sally steals the slasher's chainsaw (or phallic symbol, for film buffs who enjoy more feminist readings) and uses it against him, injuring his leg. Defeating the toxic male-dominated family secures her power as the last heroine standing, and she victoriously screams/cackles her way into a celebrated reference nod for many feminist films to come (*waves to American Psycho *).

Adelaide/Red (Lupita Nyong’o), Us (2019)

Most likely to confuse the hell out of you.

This is an ode to the monologue that sends chills up the spines of the most calm and collected horror fans. On what was supposed to be a beach-house getaway, our doppelgänger antagonists —Adelaide Wilson's "Tethered" family doubles — storm the home and introduce us to Adelaide's double Red, whereupon Nyong'o delivers one of the best exposition dumps in horror history.

Audiences can’t help but hang onto Red’s every word as she explains the Tethered's sudden emergence from the alternate universe below our world. While Red is defeated by Adelaide in the end, situating Adelaide as the film’s final girl, the finale reveals that the ultimate switch had been successfully carried out years ago by the true Tether pretending to be "real Adelaide" all along. In a violent struggle to reclaim the position of the true Adelaide, the interweaving of the two clones muddies the fine line between the "original" and the antagonist, dissolving the boundaries of what makes a Final Girl a Final Girl.

The Girl (Sheila Vand), A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night (2014)

Best dressed.

In this Iranian spaghetti western/horror film, the mysterious protagonist with no name bends horror rules in her journey to become the movie’s antagonist and final girl. An antihero teenage vampire who tortures and kills men, especially those who enact violence against women, all while keeping her identity private, “The Girl” sports a chador while riding around town on a stolen skateboard, often following sneakily behind or mirroring bystanders' movements until they escape in terror (or, you know, get got). When Islamic women in hijabs are on screen, they are most often the ones that need saving, their veils often symbolizing weakness throughout Western film culture. The Girl appropriates and smashes through this stereotype by utilizing her veil as a sign of rebellion, the film’s very own superhero and villain. She's the mysterious girl who upholds rules of reason and strength like most other final girls while simultaneously taking on a role of the film's inimitable 'slasher.'

Yvonne Miller (Kelly Jo Minter), A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child (1989)

Most likely to help a friend in need.

The final girl concept relies on their sensibility and strength. I can’t think of anything more sensible than finding a perverted dream invader with blades for fingers that sports a red and green TJ Maxx sweater hard to believe in.

For Nightmare on Elm Street 5’s final girl Yvonne Miller, doubting the powers of the infamous Freddy Krueger gave her an upper hand that made it a challenge for Krueger to terrorize her dreamscape. Making it to the end of the film along with the film's most obvious final girl and Yvonne's best friend, Alice Johnson (Lisa Wilcox), the independent and hilariously apprehensive Yvonne saves herself and her bestie who is then able to defeat Krueger in her own attempt. The rarity of two final girls — and one final girl of color, at that — in '80s slashers brought forth a new era for what final girls could be. Give Yvonne Miller her flowers, people!

Kirsty Cotton (Ashley Laurence), Hellraiser (1987)

Worst familial trauma. (Honorable mention for best hair.)

Hellraiser might be the farthest from being considered a true slasher film on this list so far, but I would be remiss if I didn’t mention Kirsty Cotton’s unique position as a final girl. Bypassing the perfection attached to the usual "damsel in distress" tropes, Kirsty refuses assistance from all men and solidifies herself as one of the more independent and badass protagonists/final girls within horror history. Both headstrong and vulnerable, she's a force that has no qualms putting her asshole husband back in his place, but also breaks down in devastation and still gets right back up to put an end to her nightmare. Kirsty takes on her own twisted family, wicked cenobites, and the infamous Pinhead in a series of exciting events that leaves no room to deny her prowess in the matter of defeating enemies.

Between confusing doppelgänger mix-ups and antiheroes turned superheroes, we can't wait to see where else the Final Girl trope can go.

Season 2 of The White Lotus kicks off just like its predecessor: with a death. Daphne (Meghann Fahy), a guest at the White Lotus resort in Sicily, is just hours away from going home when she discovers a dead body floating in the ocean.

Not long after, resort manager Valentina (Sabrina Impacciatore) rushes to the scene, where she learns that more than one guest has died. That's right: We don't just have one corpse to identify. We have multiple!

Unfortunately, The White Lotus doesn't clarify how many guests have died, so there's a major hole in the clues available for our sleuthing. However, the first episode already gives us quite a bit of information so we can get to theorizing. Here, on a scale of "living la dolce vita" to "sleeping with the fishes," are the main characters of The White Lotus Season 2, based on how likely they are to die.

5. Daphne and Valentina

Good news for Valentina: You're safe! Credit: Fabio Lovino / HBO

Congratulations to both Daphne and Valentina for being the confirmed survivors of the season! Since we see them in the first scene, we know for a fact that neither of them are the body in the water — or the other bodies we have yet to learn more details about.

Valentina's safety confirms we won't have a repeat of Armond's death from Season 1. This time around, it's the White Lotus Resort's guests who are in danger, not its staff. However, the biggest clue as to who those guests might be lies in the first White Lotus guest we meet: Daphne. In Season 1, the first guest we met was Shane. Positioning him as the character through which we first hear about the White Lotus murder suggested that he was somewhat involved — and he was! In the season finale, we find out he killed Armond.

Using that same logic for Season 2, it's highly likely that Daphne is close to the dead guests. Although, based on her frightened reaction to the body in the water, I really doubt she's responsible.

4. Tanya and Portia and Greg

Will Tanya survive murder number two at the White Lotus? Credit: Fabio Lovino / HBO

It would be a cruel world indeed if The White Lotus creator Mike White decided to kill off Tanya (Jennifer Coolidge). Coolidge is one of the only returning characters from the first season of The White Lotus, and if she survived the Murder Resort once, I fully believe she can do it again!

Since Tanya's in the safe zone, it's also likely that her fellow traveling companions, husband Greg (Jon Gries) and assistant Portia (Haley Lu Richardson) are in the clear as well. None of them have had significant interactions with Daphne either, putting them closer to the end of the list.

3. Albie and Dominic and Bert

A family trip...to murder? Credit: Fabio Lovino / HBO

The boys trip trio of Albie (Adam DiMarco), his father Dominic (Michael Imperioli), and his grandfather Bert (F. Murray Abraham) are pretty likely to survive. They haven't interacted significantly with Daphne, if we're going by that logic. So far, the only major concern is Bert. Everyone keeps reminding him of his age, and at one point in the first episode, he falls and hurts his head. Could this be foreshadowing a darker fate?

2. Mia and Lucia

They might not be guests, but they're not safe. Credit: Fabio Lovino / HBO

If there's one thing Season 1 of The White Lotus taught us, it's that the rich resort guests face no consequences for their actions while the staff and locals suffer. We know based on the first scene of Season 2 that Valentina and the rest of the resort staff are all safe. However, the opening does not account for local sex worker Lucia (Simona Tabasco) and her friend Mia (Beatrice Grannò). While neither are formally guests at the hotel, Lucia's entanglement with Dominic might mean the two of them will be hanging around at the resort more. Perhaps enough to be confused with guests?

While neither Mia or Lucia have any connection with Daphne so far, I've ranked them so high up because as non-wealthy locals, they're in a far more vulnerable position White Lotus-wise than many of the affluent guests. Their deaths would definitely be in keeping with the show's ethos that the rich emerge from bad situations unscathed.

1. Harper and Ethan and Cameron

Will this entire quartet survive? Doubtful. Credit: Courtesy of HBO

Going by the Daphne connection, her husband Cameron (Theo James) and friends Harper (Aubrey Plaza) and Ethan (Will Sharpe) are the most obvious candidates for the season's victims. Tensions are already running high in the group, what with Harper's dislike and distrust of Cameron. And you can't forget Cameron's violating NSFW power move of stripping down in front of Harper while the two of them were alone. Given the season's focus on sexual politics, it's clear something twisted is going to happen among these four. Could that something lead to... murder?

Strengthening this theory is the fact that all three of these characters are missing from the season's first scene. They could be packing their things, as Daphne does mention this is their last day at the resort. Or they could be hashing out their problems in the Ionian Sea. My guess? The latter.

It's Wednesday, time for your obligatory, weekly crypto hack story.

This time it's cryptocurrency options exchange Deribit, the largest of its kind, that enters the long, long list of hacked crypto companies. According to Deribit's official Twitter account, one of the company's hot wallets was hacked to the tune of $28 million on Tuesday, November 1.

In crypto lingo, "hot wallet" refers to a cryptocurrency wallet that's frequently used and is typically not protected as strongly as cold wallets, which should ideally hold the bulk of the company's (and its users') funds and reserves.

According to Deribit, neither client assets nor its cold wallets were affected. "It's company procedure to keep 99% of our user funds in cold storage to limit the impact of these type of events," said Deribit in a tweet.

Deribit temporarily halted deposits and withdrawals; deposits already sent will be processed, though it might take a little longer, the company said.

The loss will be covered by the company reserves, and ongoing operations will not be impacted, Deribit said.

Notably, Deribit's official blog is not available at writing time, displaying only a "critical error" message.

Deribit is the largest cryptocurrency options exchange by market share according to Coinglass. It hasn't been on the bad end of major hacks so far, but now it joins the likes of Binance, Bitfinex, and Coinbase (to name a few), all of which have suffered major hacks in the past. Hacking attempts (many of them successful) appear to be on the rise in recent months, with more than $2 billion stolen so far in 2022.
It's Wednesday, time for your obligatory, weekly crypto hack story.

This time it's cryptocurrency options exchange Deribit, the largest of its kind, that enters the long, long list of hacked crypto companies. According to Deribit's official Twitter account, one of the company's hot wallets was hacked to the tune of $28 million on Tuesday, November 1.

In crypto lingo, "hot wallet" refers to a cryptocurrency wallet that's frequently used and is typically not protected as strongly as cold wallets, which should ideally hold the bulk of the company's (and its users') funds and reserves.

According to Deribit, neither client assets nor its cold wallets were affected. "It's company procedure to keep 99% of our user funds in cold storage to limit the impact of these type of events," said Deribit in a tweet.

Deribit temporarily halted deposits and withdrawals; deposits already sent will be processed, though it might take a little longer, the company said.

The loss will be covered by the company reserves, and ongoing operations will not be impacted, Deribit said.

Notably, Deribit's official blog is not available at writing time, displaying only a "critical error" message.

Twitter's new CEO Elon Musk has tweeted that Twitter Blue's monthly subscription fee will increase to $8, and include a blue checkmark verification badge as one of its perks. Soon we may be able to see who is terminally online and gullible enough to pay Twitter for the illusion of status.

"Twitter’s current lords & peasants system for who has or doesn’t have a blue checkmark is bullshit," wrote Musk, demonstrating a fundamental misunderstanding of both Twitter verification and the feudal system. "Power to the people! Blue for $8/month."

This is an increase from Twitter Blue's current price of $4.99 per month, which itself was increased from its former monthly fee of $2.99 earlier this year. Though $8 is much less than the previously reported $20 per month that Twitter had been discussing, this still works out to be a price rise of 167 percent within a single year. Musk first floated the idea of an $8 monthly fee in an earlier tweet to Stephen King, the author being among the countless users who scorned Twitter's proposed $20 figure.

Musk also stated that verified status isn't the only perk that will soon be available with a Twitter Blue subscription. Accounts that sign up for Twitter Blue will also be shown half as many ads; be able to post longer video and audio; and their tweets will be prioritised in replies, mentions, and searches.

According to Musk, giving Twitter Blue users priority is somehow "essential to defeat spam/scam." In reality, he's installing a class system in which the voices of those who pay are amplified over those who don't. Musk is also assuming that companies aren't the most likely to pay for Twitter Blue, and won't simply monopolise replies until the whole platform is basically a microblogged billboard.

Previously Twitter verification was free, and only granted to "notable" accounts that are of public interest such as those belonging to "prominently recognized individual[s] or brands." In this way it helped combat disinformation by confirming that yes, that really was Donald Trump tweeting "covfefe," and no, @RealTaylorSwift isn't actually the real Taylor Swift.

The ability to purchase verified status would essentially render this tool useless, allowing any user to impersonate absolutely anybody with Twitter's stamp of approval. Musk is aware of this problem but apparently unconcerned, believing that such impersonation already occurs "very frequently."

Verified accounts impersonating others has been known to happen. In 2020, Australian satirical website The Chaser had its blue tick revoked after it changed the name and profile picture on its verified Twitter account to impersonate Donald Trump. The Chaser later got its tick back, before subsequently repeating the gag with other prominent figures in 2021.

However, such incidents appear relatively uncommon, possibly due in part to the fact that the difficulty in getting verified means few are willing to risk losing their badge. Making Twitter's blue tick an easily purchasable commodity is not unlikely to prompt an increase in disinformation.

According to Musk's tweets, an alternate tag will be added to accounts belonging to public figures, "which is already the case for politicians." So it's probably only a matter of time before that also becomes a status symbol Musk tries to sell. Currently, Twitter labels government and state-affiliated media accounts from countries such as the U.S., China, and Russia. Official accounts belonging to Australia's prime minister, New Zealand's prime minister, and the British royal family remain unlabeled, with only their blue tick to verify them.

The future of Twitter sounds pretty dire, though there's always the possibility that none of this actually comes to pass. After all, Musk is well known for his thoughtless tweets and failing to follow through. He's also been making a lot of noise to distract from the fact that he didn't want to buy Twitter in the first place.

But considering how vigorously Musk continues to push questionable ideas, I wouldn't hold out hope.

It's November and Thanksgiving is only weeks away. Have you decided your menu yet? If your brain has been zapped by Quordle like mine has, it probably looks something like this: "GRAVY, GREEN, BEANS, and SAUCE (Cranberry)." As you can imagine, after a trip to the supermarket armed with a five-letter-item shopping list, my kitchen is a real mess.

If Quordle is a little too challenging today, you've come to the right place for hints. There aren't just hints here, but the whole Quordle solution. Scroll to the bottom of this page, and there it is. But are you sure you need all four answers? Maybe you just need a strategy guide. Either way, scroll down, and you'll get what you need.

What is Quordle?

Quordle is a five-letter word guessing game similar to Wordle, except each guess applies letters to four words at the same time. You get nine guesses instead of six to correctly guess all four words. It looks like playing four Wordle games at the same time, and that is essentially what it is. But it's not nearly as intimidating as it sounds.

Is Quordle harder than Wordle?

Yes, though not diabolically so.

Where did Quordle come from?

Amid the Wordle boom of late 2021 and early 2022, when everyone was learning to love free, in-browser, once-a-day word guessing games, creator Freddie Meyer says he took inspiration from one of the first big Wordle variations, Dordle — the one where you essentially play two Wordles at once. He took things up a notch, and released Quordle on January 30. Meyer's creation was covered in The Guardian six days later, and now, according to Meyer, it attracts millions of daily users. Today, Meyer earns modest revenue from Patreon, where dedicated Quordle fans can donate to keep their favorite puzzle game running.

How is Quordle pronounced?

“Kwordle.” It should rhyme with “Wordle,” and definitely should not be pronounced exactly like "curdle.”

Is Quordle strategy different from Wordle?

Yes and no.

Your starting strategy should be the same as with Wordle. In fact, if you have a favorite Wordle opening word, there’s no reason to change that here. We suggest something rich in vowels, featuring common letters like C, R, and N. But you do you.

After your first guess, however, you’ll notice things getting out of control if you play Quordle exactly like Wordle.

What should I do in Quordle that I don’t do in Wordle?

Solving a Wordle puzzle can famously come down to a series of single letter-change variations. If you’ve narrowed it down to “-IGHT,” you could guess “MIGHT” “NIGHT” “LIGHT” and “SIGHT” and one of those will probably be the solution — though this is also a famous way to end up losing in Wordle, particularly if you play on “hard mode.” In Quordle, however, this sort of single-letter winnowing is a deadly trap, and it hints at the important strategic difference between Wordle and Quordle: In Quordle, you can't afford to waste guesses unless you're eliminating as many letters as possible at all times.

Guessing a completely random word that you already know isn't the solution, just to eliminate three or four possible letters you haven’t tried yet, is thought of as a desperate, latch-ditch move in Wordle. In Quordle, however, it's a normal part of the player's strategic toolset.

Is there a way to get the answer faster?

In my experience Quordle can be a slow game, sometimes dragging out longer than it would take to play Wordle four times. But a sort of blunt-force guessing approach can speed things up. The following strategy also works with Wordle if you only want the solution, and don’t care about having the fewest possible guesses:

Try starting with a series of words that puts all the vowels (including Y) on the board, along with some other common letters. We've had good luck with the three words: “NOTES,” “ACRID,” and “LUMPY.” YouTuber DougMansLand suggests four words: “CANOE,” “SKIRT,” “PLUMB,” and “FUDGY.”

Most of the alphabet is now eliminated, and you’ll only have the ability to make one or two wrong guesses if you use this strategy. But in most cases you’ll have all the information you need to guess the remaining words without any wrong guesses.

If strategy isn't helping, and you're still stumped, here are some hints:

Are there any double or triple letters in today’s Quordle words?

One word has a letter that occurs twice consecutively.

Are any rare letters being used in today’s Quordle like Q or Z?

No.

What do today’s Quordle words start with?

C, P, M, and G.

What are the answers for today’s Quordle?

Are you sure you want to know?

There’s still time to turn back.

It is Wednesday, my dudes, and there is a new Wordle! If your brain's got the midweek blues, we're here to help with handy hints, as we are every day.

If you just want today's word, you can jump straight to the end of this article for November 2's Wordle solution, for puzzle #501. If you'd rather work through it yourself, keep reading for some tips, tricks, and clues.

Where did Wordle come from?

Wordle was initially created by engineer Josh Wardle as a gift for his partner, though it quickly spread until it became an international phenomenon. Thousands of players across the globe tackle Wordle each day, with some fans even having created alternate versions of the daily word puzzle game. These include battle royale format Squabble, music identification game Heardle, and variations like Dordle and Quordle that make you guess multiple words at once.

The popularity of Wordle even reached such heights that the New York Times bought it earlier this year, while TikTok creators live-stream themselves playing it.

What's the best Wordle starting word?

The goal of Wordle is to have fun, and there's no right way to have fun. Just choose whatever starting word feels right to you, and don't let anyone shame you for it. However, if you want to take a more strategic approach, we have a few ideas to help you pick a word that will spark joy. One tip is to select a word that includes at least two different vowels, plus some common consonants like S, T, R, or N.

What happened to the Wordle archive?

The entire archive of past Wordles used to be available for anyone to play in glorious days gone by. Unfortunately it has since been taken down, with the website's creator stating it was done at the request of the New York Times.

Is Wordle getting harder?

If you're finding Wordle too easy, you can try enabling its Hard Mode to give your brain a tougher challenge. But Wordle isn't getting any harder by itself — it's the same difficulty that it's always been.

Why are there two different Wordle answers some days?

Wordle is a fun, collective experience specifically because everyone's solving for the same word every day. Occasionally, though, Wordle has accepted two different solutions as correct on the same day. This is because the New York Times made changes to the Wordle word list after acquiring it, and sometimes swaps out words from the original list. To ensure you're getting the right answer every day, refresh your browser before you play — the site will save your streak.

Here's a subtle hint for today's Wordle answer:

You might feel this way if you can't work it out!

Does today's Wordle answer have a double letter?

Nope!

Today's Wordle is a 5-letter word that starts with...

The letter... I.

Tumblr is bringing back the female-presenting nipple, allowing the formerly forbidden cherrilets as well as other flavours of nudity to return to the platform. It's an enticing lure to both former and potential new users, and fortuitous timing considering the currently proposed mass exodus from Twitter prompted by Elon Musk's takeover.

Though Tumblr had a thriving NSFW community in its heyday, its 2018 ban on adult content gutted the blogging platform and led to a drastic drop in traffic of nearly 30 percent. Today's announcement appears to be trying to undo some of that damage, and re-establish Tumblr as a sex-positive place where nudity is allowed and embraced.

"We now welcome a broader range of expression, creativity, and art on Tumblr, including content depicting the human form (yes, that includes the naked human form)," Tumblr said in a post on its staff blog.

"So, even if your creations contain nudity, mature subject matter, or sexual themes, you can now share them on Tumblr using the appropriate Community Label so that everyone remains in control of the types of content they see on their dash."

Introduced in September, Community Labels allow Tumblr users to mark their content as depicting drug and alcohol addiction, violence, or sexual themes — including "erotic writing or imagery."

"Nudity and other kinds of adult material are generally welcome," reads Tumblr's Community Guidelines, newly updated today. "We’re not here to judge your art, we just ask that you add a Community Label to your mature content so that people can choose to filter it out of their Dashboard if they prefer."

SEE ALSO: The inside story of how Tumblr lost its way

This doesn't mean Tumblr is letting users go balls to the wall on posting porn. "Visual depictions of sexually explicit acts" as well as "content with an overt focus on genitalia" are still firmly forbidden, so any actual action will have to remain implicit. However, the platform does make an exception for "historically significant" images of people going at it, such as those you might find in a "mainstream museum," as long as the appropriate Community Label has been applied.

It's unclear whether this pass extends to historically significant art that depicts bestiality, such as 1814 Japanese block print The Dream of the Fisherman's Wife or an ancient Roman statue of god Pan with a goat. Tumblr's Community Guidelines still explicitly prohibit bestiality under "violent content and threats, gore and mutilation."

Mashable has reached out to Tumblr for comment.

Tumblr has gained renewed attention recently due to Elon Musk's takeover of Twitter. Users critical of Musk's proposed changes have compared his takeover to the disastrous downfall of Tumblr after Yahoo's $1.1 billion acquisition in 2013. Enacting wildly unpopular changes such as the infamous porn ban, Yahoo and its eventual parent Verizon drastically slashed Tumblr's value as alienated users fled the formerly popular platform in droves. Current owner Automattic snapped Tumblr up six years later for just $3 million.

Yet despite Tumblr's fall from grace, the even greater revulsion at Musk's plans for Twitter have some users proposing a return to the late 2000s' blogging platform of choice. As such, Tumblr's revival of the female-presenting nipple may be just the stimulation needed to make some dig up their old accounts.

Tumblr's new nudity decree isn't quite a return to its golden age of boobs, butts, and blogs. According to CEO Matt Mullenweg, reviving Tumblr's previous "go nuts, show nuts" mantra simply isn't feasible due to how app stores', credit card companies', and governments' attitudes toward adult content have changed since it was founded in 2007.

Still, it's undeniably a firm step closer to the Tumblr of yore, when the memes were bountiful and the nipples free — in every sense of the word.

Not on Facebook anymore? Well, maybe you used to be on the social network but deleted your account long ago. Heck, maybe you never joined Facebook at all and never even gave Mark Zuckerberg your phone number or email.

Guess what? Facebook very likely has your contact information anyway! But don't worry. We've got you covered. Facebook's parent company Meta actually has a "secret tool," first noticed by Business Insider , which lets you request the deletion of personal data, like your phone number or email address.

And when we say secret, we do mean secret. It's hidden deep within Facebook's Help pages, buried beneath hundreds of words in an article titled "Information for people who don't use Meta products."

" Click here if you have a question about the rights you may have," reads the sentence where the tool is linked.

Once you click the link , you will be taken to the contact removal tool.

If you were wondering how Facebook got your contacts to begin with, it's explained right on the page. Meta products like Facebook and Instagram ask users to upload their phone's contact information in order to connect them with friends and family who are already on those platforms. By doing this, Meta then accesses and stores all of those phone numbers and email addresses. With billions of users around the world, there's a good chance you are on someone's contact list and they likely provided your info to Facebook unwittingly.

Now, you can get it removed.

1. Choose the contact info you'd like to delete

The tool provides three options to search for: a mobile number, a landline number, and an email address.

2. Enter the contact information and choose the platform to search

After you choose one, just enter the phone number or email address, and pick which platform you'd like Meta to search for it on: Facebook and Messenger, or Instagram.

3. Enter your confirmation code

Once you enter your information, Meta will send a confirmation code to the phone number or email contact that you input to make sure it's your contact information and not someone else's.

4. Confirm deletion request

After entering the code, Meta will ask you to click "confirm" if you want the info removed and blocked from ever being added again. Select this and that's it! You'll see a message saying your request was successful. When you search for the same contact information in the tool again, Meta should tell you that it couldn't be found.

As Business Insider points out, this is just a drop in the bucket when it comes to the data that Facebook has on you. But if you're not even a Facebook user, your phone number and email address is probably still a big part of that data. And even if you're not worried about Meta having your information, know that the company often shares it with third parties, too.

If you want to make sure companies like Meta have as little data on you as possible, take five minutes to request your contact info be removed.
Not on Facebook anymore? Well, maybe you used to be on the social network but deleted your account long ago. Heck, maybe you never joined Facebook at all and never even gave Mark Zuckerberg your phone number or email.

Guess what? Facebook very likely has your contact information anyway! But don't worry. We've got you covered. Facebook's parent company Meta actually has a "secret tool," first noticed by Business Insider , which lets you request the deletion of personal data, like your phone number or email address.

And when we say secret, we do mean secret. It's hidden deep within Facebook's Help pages, buried beneath hundreds of words in an article titled "Information for people who don't use Meta products."

" Click here if you have a question about the rights you may have," reads the sentence where the tool is linked.

Once you click the link , you will be taken to the contact removal tool.

If you were wondering how Facebook got your contacts to begin with, it's explained right on the page. Meta products like Facebook and Instagram ask users to upload their phone's contact information in order to connect them with friends and family who are already on those platforms. By doing this, Meta then accesses and stores all of those phone numbers and email addresses. With billions of users around the world, there's a good chance you are on someone's contact list and they likely provided your info to Facebook unwittingly.

Now, you can get it removed.

What do you get when you combine the richest man in the world and a social media app that died six years ago? Another hell site.

After buying Twitter for $44 billion, Elon Musk is floating the idea of resurrecting Vine , a short-form video app similar to TikTok that was put to rest six years ago. If he summons it back, it’ll be a shell of what it once was; an app that might walk and talk like its precious self, but lacks the soul necessary for its survival. Vine should absolutely not be reborn. And it should certainly not be brought back by Musk.

It's just the latest in a dizzying series of maneuvers by the "Chief Twit" since he took over Twitter , fired a ton of staff , ordered employees to print out their code , is planning to charge verified users to keep their badges , and removed some employees abilities to do their content moderation jobs — an invaluable service to slow the spread of misinformation and hate speech — just weeks before midterm elections take place in the U.S.

Why did Twitter kill Vine?

Unlike with most things Musk, this time it doesn't seem like he's bluffing, unfortunately. Musk told engineers at Twitter to begin working on a Vine reboot to launch by the end of the year, Axios first reported . It's a surprising reversal of fate for a failed Twitter product. Twitter bought Vine for $30 million in 2012, but shuttered the app in 2016 — a move that devastated Vine creators and fans. But it simply could not make enough money to stay alive and was losing popularity to apps like Instagram, which added new features at a rate that Vine just couldn't match, as the Verge reported. The app was fun, but it ultimately wasn't profitable.

But facts have never stopped Musk from trying to do something. Now that Musk is in the driver's seat, Twitter engineers are looking at Vine's old code; code that hasn't been updated in more than half a decade. Sara Beykpour, whose LinkedIn shows she worked as a senior director of product management at Twitter, tweeted that she worked at Vine and led the shutdown of the app.

"This code is 6+ years old. Some of it is 10+," Beykpour wrote. "You don't want to look there. If you want to revive Vine, you should start over. trust me on this one guys."

On Sunday, Musk polled his Twitter followers, asking : "Bring back Vine?" Over 69 percent of his followers said yes.

MrBeast, a creator with 109 million subscribers on YouTube and 15 million followers on Twitter responded, "If you did that and actually competed with TikTok [sic] that’d be hilarious." To which Musk replied, "What could we do to make it better than TikTok?"

Here's a suggestion, Elon: Leave Vine alone. The memory of Vine will remain stronger if the app stays in the past. We don't need a new TikTok.

At its peak, about 100 million people were using Vine every month, according to TechCrunch. Compare that to TikTok, which has a billion users every month; or Instagram, which surpassed 2 billion monthly users in 2021. After Vine was shuttered, most of the more iconic Vines were posted on YouTube and the more successful Vine stars pivoted to Instagram or YouTube before the app officially died.

A zombie app has no soul

If Musk’s work at Twitter is any indication of his ability to run a social media company, it should go without saying that he should probably keep his paws off other social media sites, too. Not only because he has more money than any human being should (and because of that or in spite of it, he’s pretty terrible and so embarrassingly out of touch) but also because he seems to be wrong a lot of the time.

Consider when he tweeted that he would donate $6 billion to end world hunger , and then didn’t do that. Or when he claimed in March 2020 that people worried about Covid-19 were " dumb " and said the U.S. would have " close to zero new cases " of Covid-19 by the end of April 2020. He's also tweeted that " pronouns suck ;" he tweeted a picture of Bill Gates and said "in case u need to lose a boner fast;" and he famously runs Tesla, a company with racist and sexist environments that employees have called a " modern-day sweatshop ."

Musk has done just about nothing to let Twitter users feel confident about his capability to run a single social media site, let alone resurrect one.

Beyond my firm belief that Musk is unable to resurrect Vine in any positive way, there's still the issue of recreating the magic that was Vine. It would be impossible to have the app the same way we once did no matter who's recreating it.

Vine was great, but its greatness relied on an organic system — to fill your feed, you followed friends, family, and influencers whose content you wanted to spot. For Vine to be successful in 2023 and beyond, your community would have to all migrate back onto Vine in order for it to resemble the app we once loved. But Vine existed in a different era of the internet. It existed before Donald Trump, COVID-19, and the misinformation scandals that have forced social media sites to face a heavy reckoning. And in the six years since Vine's death, our brains have become primed to respond to algorithmic recommendations on apps like Instagram and TikTok.

All the stars who made Vine what it was have since moved on to other apps or have quit the internet altogether. King Bach moved to TikTok and YouTube, and started acting on the big screen; Lele Pons stars in a YouTube Original docuseries about her life and hosts her own podcast on Spotify; Rudy Mancuso has a successful career on YouTube; and the list goes on. There's no way to bring back the past when society has continued evolving without it. We simply no longer consume media in the same way. Furthermore, a newly revived Vine wouldn't be filling a void of media. We already have TikTok for short-form viral videos; Instagram reels for reposting your TikTok videos; and YouTube for posting collections of TikTok videos.

Beyond being a weird ego boost for a rich man and his fans, what purpose would a Vine reboot even fulfill?

Social media apps, much like villains in The Dark Knight, have two real options, as Harvey Dent says: "You either die a hero, or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain."

Vine died a hero. Let it rest.

We, as a people, are in constant search for a place to talk shit without fear of repercussions. In this enduring quest for gossip, society created Yik Yak , an app that allowed users to anonymously connect with everyone within 5 miles (RIP); private accounts on Instagram and Twitter ; finstas and fake accounts and Close Friends Stories .

More recently, Twitter launched Twitter Circles , which allows users to add up to 150 of their closest allies who can see tweets you might want shared with fewer people. But, of course, what is the point of using Twitter Circles when your account is already private? Which is more useful — an account with tweets that can only be accessed by users you allow to follow you, or a public account with specific tweets shown to some eyes only?

Ease of setup

Here are your options:

Make a private account on Twitter from the get go. Only allow specific people to follow you. Make your public account on Twitter private, allowing everyone who once walked through your follow gates to stay. Add up to 150 people into your Twitter Circles.

There is simply no argument here. Making your public account on Twitter private is by far the easiest way to set up a safe shit-talking space on the social media app. It’s not difficult to add people to a Circle, but it is a little agonizing right now. You have to manually add each and every person by scrolling through a list of mutuals, which is too time-consuming. Going with a private account is literally as easy as pressing a button.

Community

There are two ways to set up a private account on Twitter, and one ensures far more community-building opportunities than the other. The first way is to create an account as a private account from the beginning and only allow in the most exclusive followers; the second, and potentially more fun way, is to take your public account that may have followers you don't know queued in, and make it private.

For Twitter Circles, all you need to do is add your friends to your top 150 and you'll be connected. But this is practically like sending a message to a really big group chat; you're likely talking to people who are already in your network; who are already members of your community.

If you're looking to grow a community and become closer with a larger swath of people, the most effective way is to make your public account private. Sure, you might not know everyone immediately, but that little lock next to your name makes followers feel like they've been invited into a secret little club.

And, as a user with a private account, you'll be pretty elite. According to a recent poll from Pew Research Center , a majority of Twitter users have a public profile.

That said, Circles have their advantages from a community standpoint, too. First of all, if your account is private from the start, you have to tell people about it and manually accept their follow requests, which is a pain. It’s especially bad when you have to decline a request because that person might be offended and you might have to explain it to them. That really sucks. It’s arguably more cumbersome than just adding some people to a Circle and calling it a day.

Turning a well-followed public account into a private one may be as easy as flipping a switch, but it’s got downsides. There will be undesirables in the crowd reading those tweets because you probably didn’t carefully curate your following beforehand. The benefit of Circles is that you get to choose exactly who sees each of those tweets. You have full control. You are the lord of a little online kingdom. That may not appeal to everyone, but it’s a nice option to have.

Privacy

Anything you post online has the chance to become completely public. Screenshots exist. But there are benefits to having a private account or tweeting only to your Circle in order to ensure some small level of privacy and protection.

Your most secure bet if you value privacy is to start with a private account. You’ll have the most control over who sees your tweets that way. A Circle is the second-most private option here because, while you have final say over who is in the Circle, there’s room for website or user error here. Circles are a relatively new feature and there’s always a slim possibility that Circle tweets could one day become public, or you could accidentally post a public tweet that was meant for your Circle.

Oh, and the needs of your followers matter here, too. You can be added to a Circle without your consent, so you might see things you don’t want to see.

The least private option here is to take your public account and lock it down — you never know how many haters are lurking in your follows. The most private way really depends on how you use a private account versus a Twitter Circle, but nothing beats a fully locked-down account. If you trust each person you've added to your following list, you should be solid.

The verdict

Overall, a private account has to be the winner here. That option has been around for a lot longer than Circles, so strategies and etiquette for running a successful private account are common knowledge at this point. Circles are still in their infancy; it will take years before they’re as established as a locked account, assuming Twitter lasts that long.

Whether you go with a locked account or a Twitter Circle for your spicy rants, always be careful. You never know who might end up seeing that content someday.

On Monday, Oct. 31, South Korean live streaming app V Live notified users that it'd be shutting down on Dec. 31, 2022. The closure isn't a surprise — in March, HYBE, owner of the competing app Weverse, announced it had acquired V Live and intended to close the app — but it is a bummer for artists and fans. V Live is the largest-ever archive of live-streamed K-pop content. Where will that content live on when the app goes dark?

Owned by Naver, V Live launched in 2015 as a tool for Korean artists to connect with fans. They did that primarily through live streams, which were then saved in the app as on-demand videos. As K-pop exploded in global popularity, V Live connected these entertainers with an international audience who watched them eat meals, celebrate birthdays, and produce music in real time.

V Live streams were popular, drawing hundreds of thousands and sometimes millions of viewers. It was a primary communication tool for many groups but especially for BTS, who hosted their popular series Run BTS! exclusively on the platform from 2015 to 2020. In total, BTS has uploaded over 860 videos to their V Live channel, acquiring more than 12 billion likes and 2 billion comments.

In March, HYBE — the media conglomerate that manages BTS, as well as major artists like Seventeen, Tomorrow X Together, and ZICO — announced that it intended to integrate V Live with its home-grown fan communication platform Weverse.

That was a wholly competitive move. Though Weverse is the most comprehensive fan communication app on the market, half of the industry still uses competitors Universe and Bubble.

But nearly every single artist used V Live to stream, some even weekly.

Yesterday, V Live said any artist who joined Weverse before Dec. 31, 2022 would have their content transferred to the app. Fans were worried. What would happen to the content of groups who didn't join Weverse?

In a comment to Mashable, a Weverse representative assured that artists and their companies have been given ample time to download their archives for future use elsewhere. "We have consistently informed channel operators... with full information on content backup and download for about a year," since November 2021, they said.

"We are in the process of executing content migration to Weverse," they added, "and [are] planning to complete the process by Dec. 28, 2022... Following the integration, non-Weverse artists’ contents will no longer be accessible to the public." That means the content belonging to non-Weverse artists — which, in some cases, is hundreds of hours of streams — may disappear as early as Dec. 28 of this year before the app itself vanishes after the 31st.

We asked the representative if an artist who decides to join Weverse after the closure of V Live would find an archive of their past V Live content available in Weverse. They replied, "Artists who have decided to join Weverse so far will be able to transfer their contents to Weverse," but didn't say if artists who joined after the closure would have their content transferred, too.

Since August, Weverse artists like Tomorrow X Together, Seventeen, and Enhypen have streamed exclusively on the platform ahead of the closure of V Live. Weverse attempted to launch a live streaming service of its own in early 2022, but fans complained it was buggy. Its acquisition of V Live in March was seen as an investment in making that feature better.

V Live "has long been the go-to platform for real-time communication between artists and fans," said the Weverse representative, and its integration will enable Weverse to "continue to evolve as a global fandom life platform."

Best Amazon device deal

Why we like it

The latest Echo Show 10, according to Mashable's RJ Andersen, is "the perfect starter device for someone who hasn’t purchased an Echo yet." Standout features include its sleek design, motion tracking abilities, and impressive speaker quality. Though the base is a little bulky for tight spaces, RJ found that it's worth it to sacrifice some counter space. At $169.99, it's also at its lowest price ever — save 32% in honor of Alexa's birthday.

Ever since Amazon acquired iRobot, we've been seeing some new low prices — including this new all-time low on the Roomba J7. At $349.99, you'll save 42% and get a robot vacuum that actually makes robotic vacuuming a hands-free process. The J7's claim to fame is its PrecisionVision Navigation tech, which uses a combination of physical sensors and upgraded recognition software to help it avoid obstacles — like chargers, stray socks, and other clutter. In other words, you don't have to pre-clean before it cleans.

YouTube has been the de facto home of video content on the internet for 15 years. Now, that monopoly is growing.

The Google-owned video site announced Tuesday that it would start rolling out Primetime Channels, a feature that turns YouTube into a hub for subscription streaming services. An “early version” launched in the U.S. along with the announcement. YouTube says you can go to the Movies & TV hub on the site to find 30 or so services you can subscribe to, though, at the time of writing, that wasn’t working for me.

All the stars are here. Credit: YouTube

To start, YouTube isn’t including the real heavy hitters like Netflix and HBO Max. The biggest name on the list right now is probably Paramount+, with AMC+, Showtime, Starz, and Shudder rounding out some of the other notable names. YouTube also said NBA League Pass (which you can use to watch any out-of-market NBA game) is coming soon.

For clarity’s sake, this is not the same as YouTube TV. That’s a $65/mo subscription service that lets you watch live TV. It’s also not the same as the movie rentals that have been available on YouTube for years.

Anyway, YouTube has promised to YouTube-ify these channels, even going so far as to add Primetime Channels recommendations to your personal algorithm. One of the big selling points here is that you can watch a movie trailer on YouTube like you normally would, and then just watch the movie on the same site. How novel.

SEE ALSO: Creators say YouTube Shorts has a transphobia problem

Eagle-eyed folks will recognize that this is very similar to Amazon’s Channels ecosystem, which serves the same purpose and also includes Paramount+, Showtime, and Starz. However, YouTube has the minor advantage of being a free video hub, unlike Prime Video. Still, the two features are very similar.

Regardless, this could be a convenient way to keep all your videos in one place. That was the original mission of YouTube, so it just makes sense.

Queerbaiting has been on our tongues for a while now. But over the past 12 months, the term has erupted into our lives with some vigour. From questions surrounding Harry Styles' sexuality to calling out movies for their almost-depictions of queer characters, the trailer for Wakanda Forever, and the recent Doctor Who storyline springs to mind.

Queerbaiting is an accusatory term that brings into question the validity of someone’s sexual identity. As a bisexual person, I find the term hard to reconcile with, for a myriad of reasons. My main issue is that the premise of queerbaiting stands to question sexuality loudly by demanding proof and making people feel they need to justify their presence in queer spaces. In this context, it feels inherently biphobic, transphobic, homophobic, and ultimately wrong.

Heartstopper actor Kit Connor — who plays Nick Nelson in the Netflix show — is the latest in a string of people in the public eye who have been forced to come out because they've been accused of queerbaiting. In a recent tweet, the 18-year-old actor said; "Back for a minute. i’m [sic] bi. congrats on forcing an 18 year old to out himself. I think some of you missed the point of the show. Bye."

This comes after mounting pressure from fans for clarity on his sexual identity, amongst accusations of queerbaiting.

What is queerbaiting?

"Queerbaiting" is used to describe the actions of a writer, director, or producer, or those in entertainment marketing, who give a character or storyline traits that appear to be promising of queer interactions, with no "payoff." You might remember it happening between characters Okoye and Ayo in Black Panther, to Beca and Chloe in Pitch Perfect.

The internet has, as it usually does, co-opted the term. Now, some people use "queerbaiting" to describe the actions of an actual person who doesn't (openly) identify with the LGBTQ community but displays queer tendencies through the way they dress, their body language, or their reluctance to answer questions about their sexuality, or to give themselves a label. Sometimes celebrities are accused of capitalising on queer culture, with the likes of Harry Styles and Billie Eilish coming under fire.

The issue is that by calling them queerbaiters, we’re also telling other people who haven't found a label, or who may not identify with a label, that their expression of sexuality is wrong. Sexuality, like gender, is fluid and only ours to understand and express. It’s deeply personal and often more complicated than fitting the binary of being heterosexual or homosexual.

This demand for everyone to be "out" and visible is problematic.

This demand for everyone to be "out" and visible is problematic. Nobody, not even celebrities, owe us their sexuality. Placing expectations on someone in a way that is designed to try and force them to come out, or to examine their identity in such a public forum is abusive. Not just affecting the person under accusation, but people outside the spotlight too who are side-eyeing the conversations.

Why is it bad to question someone’s sexuality?

When you question someone's sexuality, you’re also questioning someone’s understanding of themselves. It’s invasive, to say the least.

"Questioning someone's sexuality or the way that they arrive at their identity is harmful because it erases their experiences."

"Questioning someone's sexuality or the way that they arrive at their identity is harmful because it erases their experiences and undermines the struggles that that person may have gone through, or is going through," Gigi Engle, ACS, certified sex educator at dating app 3Fun and author of All The F*cking Mistakes: a guide to sex, love, and life , tells me. "The impact of that on someone's mental health can be hugely damaging."

Being open and honest about identity and sex comes with a heavy price because we unequivocally do not live in an equal, equitable, or accepting society. Often, living as an out person comes with consequences of violence , discrimination, and ostracisation, meaning that the vast majority of the world's LGBTQ population stays firmly behind closet doors , where it is seemingly safer to exist.

According to a report by LGBTQ rights organisation Stonewall , only half (46 percent) of lesbian, gay, and bi people and trans people (47 percent) feel able to be open about their sexual orientation or gender identity to everyone in their family. The same study found that two thirds (64 percent) of LGBTQ people had experienced anti-LGBTQ violence or abuse. So, it’s no wonder that queer folk are more likely to experience mental health issues and addiction than heterosexual people. Being forced to choose between your true self and presenting as another is a huge mental burden to carry, one that is not deserving of interrogation.

This is not to say that LGBTQ people are predisposed to mental illness because of their sexual identity, but rather that society inflicts a predisposition on them because of their inherent marginalisation. Add to that an unwillingness to unlearn conscious and unconscious bias from inside and outside the LGBTQ community, plus torrid misinformation about who the LGBTQ community are across all intersections of society, and you’ve got yourself a disastrous mixing pot.

Forcing someone to come out when they haven’t fully figured things out can cause serious, lasting trauma. Actor Rebel Wilson was forced to take her coming out journey out of the hands of the Sydney Morning Herald, who threatened to leak her same-sex relationship status before she has even had a chance to speak with her family and friends. The columnist, Andrew Hornery, who gave Wilson only two days "notice" to compile a statement, was so enraged by her coming out publicly ahead of his article, that he wrote an entire (now deleted) article about her bad behaviour. The audacity. Wilson recently spoke about her experiences in a statement to The Australian , explaining that it had caused an immense amount of upset. "I just thought it was kind of grubby behaviour," she said, "Basically, with the situation where a journalist is threatening to out you, you’ve got to hurry, and some people we didn’t get a chance to tell before it came out publicly. And that’s not ideal."

What some may not realise is that forcing someone to come to a conclusion on their sexuality before they’re ready can affect a person's personal safety, both mentally and physically. Using a term like queerbaiting to describe someone who may have a more fluid expression of sex and identity places them firmly in harm's way. While celebrities might face whiplash-inducing backlash from trolls, peers, and fans, regular folk may find themselves faced with violence, disownment from family, homelessness, and persecution. Equally, when we openly discuss and project sexual identity onto people, those around us play witness to the fallout.

Should queerbaiting be scrapped for a more representative term?

Some have argued that using the term queerbaiting is fine, in certain situations. Like calling out a film or TV trailer for depicting what appears to be a queer storyline and then not providing one. The rationale is that they have duped or fooled queer people into being emotionally invested in a queer-friendly romantic storyline, getting them to part with their hard-earned cash, only for them to be disappointed. This causes a wave of understandable anger. Queer people are not here to be fetishised as a titillation technique for audiences, queer people do not exist to propel a storyline into tick-box territory either. These criticisms are valid, particularly when a company seeks to make money or attract audiences through performative queerness.

When it comes to accusing human beings of queerbaiting, calling for proof and pay-off just feels icky. We also need to remember that not addressing queer feelings or living openly is a very real and sad side of the LGBTQ experience for a lot of people, even in the UK. This is because of historic persecution dating back to 1553, when Henry VIII’s government began persecuting MSM (men who have sex with men) under The Buggery Act . If found guilty, it was punishable by death. This law remained in effect until 1861.

Two decades later, in 1885, an amendment was brought into law that meant any sexual act between men could be prosecuted under "gross indecency." The only reason that lesbianism wasn’t included in the amendment, was that legislators didn’t think it possible for women to behave in such a way. Even in a more modern Britain, unconscious bias and overt homophobia still stigmatises LGBTQ folk as sexually deviant and predatory, in part thanks to the criminalisation of homosexuality , which lasted until 1968 in England and Wales, and 1980 in Scotland. Later in 1988, during Conservative Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher’s tenure, a piece of legislation called Section 28 was passed, which prohibited councils and schools from "promoting the teaching of the acceptability of homosexuality as a pretended family relationship." This led to an influx of "educational" (read: problematic propaganda) videos showing gay men, specifically, as predatory, and paedophilic. Here, it bears repeating that there is not one single connection between homosexuality and paedophilia . None whatsoever. There never ever has been. However, the legacy of that misinformation lives on, even today.

This is why I can sympathise with my community for wanting the "queerbaiting" presented in TV and film to end, but at the same time, I feel so inwardly conflicted about using a term that pathologises a behaviour, even if it doesn’t mean to. We desperately want and need representation, but we are not owed it by anyone other than those writing the media we consume. While queerbating is supposed to mean this very thing, the way it has been co-opted feels as though it has evolved to mean something persecutory. I’m not sure how we reconcile that.

This is why you’ll often find LGBTQ people using queerbaiting to call out appropriation when it arises to sell movie tickets. And, fair enough. Commodifying or appropriating LGBTQ coding (originally a way for LGBTQ people to signal their sexuality subtly to other community members without being outed and persecuted, now a way to say characters are LGBTQ without overtly saying so), and caricatures in non-LGBTQ characters and storylines is equally as rotten, especially when history is filled with people being persecuted and executed for displaying those same characteristics being fetishised as a wink-wink-nudge-nudge ploy. Even now, across the world, LGBTQ people face that same level of dehumanisation and threat to life.

So, no matter the context, I have to ask: What are we really saying when we use the term "queerbaiting"? "It's a term that people use to devalue queerness," Engle says, "It's just fucked up to say. We don't say anything is heterobaiting."

The phrase queerbaiting erases a massive part of the queer experience we don’t talk about enough, which is that you do not need to prove sexuality in any which way to be deserving of community, support, and love. The word is problematic. Maybe it’s time to use a new one?

When SpaceX hurled its whopping rocket into the sky Tuesday morning, that was likely the last time Elon Musk could boast he had the most powerful rocket in use — at least for the time being.

The Falcon Heavy, with 27 engines firing from a trio of boosters, launched a secret national security mission for the U.S. Space Force. The rocket is a beast, with basically three of the company's workhorse Falcon 9 rockets strapped together, combining to offer 5 million pounds of thrust.

The impressive punch from a rocket that resembles Poseidon's trident could be vastly outdone in a couple of weeks by NASA's mega moon rocket, which will soon sit on the Kennedy Space Center launchpad next door. Engineers designed the Space Launch System to have 8.8 million pounds of thrust, enough to keep eight Boeing 747s aloft. The U.S. space agency has planned its maiden voyage to the moon on Nov.14, though hardware glitches, hydrogen leaks, and weather have scuttled several previous attempts already. NASA has announced Nov. 16 and 19 as backup dates.

The relative lack of fanfare for this SpaceX launch, Falcon Heavy's fourth since its much-hyped debut in February 2018, may be an indication of how much the space economy has evolved over the past five years, with Musk's company leading the way. What was novel and exotic then has become seemingly commonplace today, with commercial launches announced frequently in the media.

When Musk shot a red Tesla Roadster into space with the rocket the first time, tourists jammed Florida's Space Coast to catch a glimpse and witness the sonic booms, with a level of enthusiasm harking back to NASA's Apollo heyday. Falcon Heavy even rose from the same hallowed launchpad that shot Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and Michael Collins to the moon.

Spectators also came to watch the eventful landing of rocket boosters. Before SpaceX, rocket hardware was routinely ditched in the ocean after a single use. Now startups and competitors are following SpaceX's example, wanting to recycle their equipment to lower the cost of space travel. The notion that a private company could accomplish all this earned SpaceX a new level of respect and galvanized its efforts to build an even more stupefying rocket, the Starship, to support Musk's vision of a human colony on Mars.

Falcon Heavy, which hadn't roared into the sky for more than three years because of issues with its satellite cargo, left the ground for the USSF-44 mission at 9:41 a.m. ET on Nov. 1. It's expected to make two deliveries into an Earth orbit 22,000 miles above the equator, among them a microsatellite, known as TETRA-1, built by a Boeing subsidiary.

In a 2020 statement, Space Force's Brig. Gen. Tim Sejba, who was then director of innovation and prototyping for the Space and Missile Systems Center at New Mexico's Kirtland Air Force Base, said TETRA-1, and other such contracts, are helping the nation meet the "future space warfighter's needs."

"One of our primary goals is to be more agile in the development and deployment of innovative space assets," Sejba said.

On Tuesday, SpaceX landed Falcon Heavy's two side boosters at the spaceport in Cape Canaveral, Florida, to be refurbished for another upcoming flight. But because this particular mission required a lot of fuel — meaning Falcon Heavy was probably lifting a really heavy load — the company intentionally did not try to recover the center core like it did in June 2019 on an ocean platform hundreds of miles offshore, according to Space Force.

While Falcon Heavy may have lost some of its PR luster, it's not lacking in demand (though there's far more demand for its smaller Falcon 9 rocket, a vehicle that can accommodate most satellite missions today). NASA recently announced it had penned a deal with SpaceX to use the powerful rocket to send the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, an infrared telescope that will study dark matter and take pictures of faraway exoplanets, into orbit in October 2026. The observatory's total launch cost is $255 million, according to the U.S. space agency.

And though the rocket may soon lose its reputation as the most powerful operating, SpaceX could win back the accolade with its development of Starship, a super-heavy-class rocket NASA plans to use to shuttle astronauts from its future lunar-orbiting base to the moon's surface. That's in addition to Musk's plans to use a fleet of Starships to one day build a settlement on the red planet.

Standing 400-feet tall, the Starship, an entirely reusable stainless steel contraption, could have about twice as much launch thrust as NASA's moon rocket. Previous Starship prototype test flights exploded until one succeeded with an unscathed landing in May 2021.

At a February event in Boca Chica, Texas, where the Starship is based, Musk said the jumbo rocket would fly in orbit before the end of this year. But the billionaire founder has become notorious for making overly ambitious timeline claims.

"We are faced with a choice of which future do you want?" he said. "Do you want the future where we become a spacefaring civilization, and are in many worlds, and are out there among the stars, or one where we are forever confined to Earth?"
When SpaceX hurled its whopping rocket into the sky Tuesday morning, that was likely the last time Elon Musk could boast he had the most powerful rocket in use — at least for the time being.

The Falcon Heavy, with 27 engines firing from a trio of boosters, launched a secret national security mission for the U.S. Space Force. The rocket is a beast, with basically three of the company's workhorse Falcon 9 rockets strapped together, combining to offer 5 million pounds of thrust.

The impressive punch from a rocket that resembles Poseidon's trident could be vastly outdone in a couple of weeks by NASA's mega moon rocket, which will soon sit on the Kennedy Space Center launchpad next door. Engineers designed the Space Launch System to have 8.8 million pounds of thrust, enough to keep eight Boeing 747s aloft. The U.S. space agency has planned its maiden voyage to the moon on Nov.14, though hardware glitches, hydrogen leaks, and weather have scuttled several previous attempts already. NASA has announced Nov. 16 and 19 as backup dates.

The relative lack of fanfare for this SpaceX launch, Falcon Heavy's fourth since its much-hyped debut in February 2018, may be an indication of how much the space economy has evolved over the past five years, with Musk's company leading the way. What was novel and exotic then has become seemingly commonplace today, with commercial launches announced frequently in the media.

When Musk shot a red Tesla Roadster into space with the rocket the first time, tourists jammed Florida's Space Coast to catch a glimpse and witness the sonic booms, with a level of enthusiasm harking back to NASA's Apollo heyday. Falcon Heavy even rose from the same hallowed launchpad that shot Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and Michael Collins to the moon.

Spectators also came to watch the eventful landing of rocket boosters. Before SpaceX, rocket hardware was routinely ditched in the ocean after a single use. Now startups and competitors are following SpaceX's example, wanting to recycle their equipment to lower the cost of space travel. The notion that a private company could accomplish all this earned SpaceX a new level of respect and galvanized its efforts to build an even more stupefying rocket, the Starship, to support Musk's vision of a human colony on Mars.

Falcon Heavy, which hadn't roared into the sky for more than three years because of issues with its satellite cargo, left the ground for the USSF-44 mission at 9:41 a.m. ET on Nov. 1. It's expected to make two deliveries into an Earth orbit 22,000 miles above the equator, among them a microsatellite, known as TETRA-1, built by a Boeing subsidiary.

In a 2020 statement, Space Force's Brig. Gen. Tim Sejba, who was then director of innovation and prototyping for the Space and Missile Systems Center at New Mexico's Kirtland Air Force Base, said TETRA-1, and other such contracts, are helping the nation meet the "future space warfighter's needs."

"One of our primary goals is to be more agile in the development and deployment of innovative space assets," Sejba said.

On Tuesday, SpaceX landed Falcon Heavy's two side boosters at the spaceport in Cape Canaveral, Florida, to be refurbished for another upcoming flight. But because this particular mission required a lot of fuel — meaning Falcon Heavy was probably lifting a really heavy load — the company intentionally did not try to recover the center core like it did in June 2019 on an ocean platform hundreds of miles offshore, according to Space Force.

While Falcon Heavy may have lost some of its PR luster, it's not lacking in demand (though there's far more demand for its smaller Falcon 9 rocket, a vehicle that can accommodate most satellite missions today). NASA recently announced it had penned a deal with SpaceX to use the powerful rocket to send the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, an infrared telescope that will study dark matter and take pictures of faraway exoplanets, into orbit in October 2026. The observatory's total launch cost is $255 million, according to the U.S. space agency.

And though the rocket may soon lose its reputation as the most powerful operating, SpaceX could win back the accolade with its development of Starship, a super-heavy-class rocket NASA plans to use to shuttle astronauts from its future lunar-orbiting base to the moon's surface. That's in addition to Musk's plans to use a fleet of Starships to one day build a settlement on the red planet.

Amazon Music Prime is adding 98 million songs to its ad-free subscription streaming service, significantly increasing its catalogue from two million tunes to 100 million. You'll only be able to play them on shuffle, though.

Announced today, Amazon Music Prime's catalogue of songs just grew to 50 times its size, its track count now matching that of its dedicated music streaming service Amazon Music Unlimited. It isn't clear exactly what tracks are being added to Prime, but with such a large boost to the numbers there's a good chance it will include a few songs you know. It probably won't be 98 million Gregorian chants, in any case.

Amazon Music Prime comes bundled in your Amazon Prime subscription, so you may consider checking it out if you've already signed up to stream Rings of Power and get next-day toilet paper deliveries. This enormous influx of potential bangers undercuts Amazon Music Unlimited's large library as one of its main selling points, potentially making the higher tier subscription less attractive to some.

However, Unlimited still has something arguably more important that Amazon Music Prime does not: the ability to play specific songs on demand.

While Amazon Prime Music now has the same number of songs as Amazon Music Unlimited, Prime users won't be able to choose a specific song they want to listen to. So if you want to jam to "Dream of You" by CHUNG HA (with R3HAB) for example — and you absolutely should — you'll have to shuffle play the K-pop artist's album QUERENCIA and hope the RNG gods bless you. For worse odds, you could also shuffle play a playlist that includes the song you want, or shuffle play the artist's whole catalogue.

This Amazon-mandated shuffling also means you can't listen to an album's tracks in sequence, which is practically sacrilege to many music fans. In fact, last year Spotify disabled its default auto-shuffle feature on Adele's album 30 at the singer's request, before also getting rid of it for all artists.

"This was the only request I had in our ever changing industry!" Adele tweeted at the time. "We don’t create albums with so much care and thought into our track listing for no reason. Our art tells a story and our stories should be listened to as we intended."

As such, Amazon Prime Music isn't your best option if you use Alexa and want to control what specific tracks you play or listen to an album as the artist intended. You'd be better off either shelling out $8.99 for an Amazon Music Ultimate subscription or sticking with one of the many streaming services that play nice with Alexa, such as Spotify, Apple Music, or Pandora.

Amazon Prime Music's shuffled music is also only available in standard definition, which is fine for the average user but may irritate audiophiles. In contrast, Amazon Music Unlimited offers on-demand high definition music streaming — as well as some Ultra HD and Spatial audio tracks.

Amazon has also announced that Amazon Music Prime now has the largest selection of ad-free shows evaluated as "top podcasts" by podcast database Podchaser. Ratings and reviews are factored in when determining this list, which includes Dr. Death, SmartLess, and various Amazon Exclusive podcasts such as Killer Psyche Daily. Keke Palmer's new podcast Baby, this is Keke Palmer is also premiering today as an Amazon Exclusive show.

The ol' Creel House from Stranger Things Season 4 has hit the market for a cool $1.5 million.

The site of Vecna's lair in Hawkins and previous home of Victor and Virginia Creel and their doomed kidlets, the house is one of the most important locations in the Netflix series' fourth season. The real house is located at 906 East 2nd Avenue in Rome, Georgia, about an hour and a half from the city of Atlanta.

Built in 1882 by solicitor and attorney Colonel Hamilton Yancey, the over 5,000-square-foot house has previously been a bed and breakfast known as Claremont House, as the listing by Toles, Temple, and Wright details.

The Victorian-style house sold in 2019 for $350,000, according to Zillow. It has five bedrooms, five bathrooms, eight fireplaces, a guest house with two bedrooms and a bathroom, over an acre of land, and that all-important walk-up attic beneath that mansard roof. The whole house has been renovated, except the listing describes the attic as "more accurately described as an unfinished third floor."

In case you're wondering, real estate agents TTW are well aware of the fandom behind such a property.

"Don't be surprised if you find some residual demogorgons skulking about the property. In the event that things get too strange and even go awry, a funeral home is located nearby," the listing reads. "Time is of the essence. So if you’re thinking about running up that hill to make the deal to become the next owners of this magnificent dwelling, don’t let the grandfather clock chime even once."

Back in June, Netflix told Mashable the Stranger Things production team had gone hunting for a creepy-looking building for the Creel House, which needed to feature vertical architecture and (importantly for the story) a third-floor attic. Production designer Chris Trujillo saw in this house vibes akin to the Bates House from Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 horror classic Psycho, the streaming service said. The owners, who had only just bought the house months before Netflix got in touch, were planning to renovate, so the locations team were able to tailor the house for the exterior shots, boarding up windows and distressing the outside.

Plus the house is located less than five miles from Berry College, which Netflix used to film the scenes at the fictional Pennhurst Mental Hospital where Nancy and Robin visit Victor Creel.

We've delved into the Creel House even further, if you loved it as much as we did.

There is no way to know how many people are doomscrolling on Twitter during the Elon Musk era. But here's a good proxy statistic: the number of users following Doomscrolling Reminder Bot. It's just what it sounds like — a bot that will politely remind you to take a break from obsessively reading depressing news on the service. Created in 2021, the bot usually does modest numbers: a few dozen followers gained, or a handful lost, per day.

Then as Musk arrived at Twitter HQ on Wednesday, according to Social Blade, nearly 19,000 Twitter users suddenly decided they needed doomscrolling reminders. Another 3,200 needed them the next day, and then after a record-busting weekend for new doomscrollers, 3,400 tweeps followed the bot on Halloween.

Why might that be? Because Musk is "flooding the zone with shit," to use a favorite phrase of Trump ally Steve Bannon, in a manner not seen since Trump was on the service back in 2020. There are too many terrible signs of change for us to keep track of them all without doomscrolling. The new CEO had already made Twitter take on $13 billion in debt as part of his purchase; a very Trumpian business tactic, and one that has a history of hollowing companies out.

But now Musk appears to have gone full MAGA. Not just in his politics or the accounts to which he responds, but in the sheer incompetent, impulsive, dictatorship-by-tweet chaos of it all. His constant need for attention beckons. And we, the users of Twitter, seem to have fallen into the same trap as we did in those dark days of 2017 — letting narcissistic provocations live rent-free in our heads.

Let's recap. Since taking over the world's most important high-speed communication platform, Musk has tweeted (then deleted without comment) misinformation about the attack on Nancy Pelosi's husband (in Hillary Clinton's replies, of all places). He slammed one award-winning UK newspaper as a "far left wing propaganda machine" while essentially calling the New York Times fake news. Reports suggest he's reexamining Twitter's hate speech policy, particularly as it applies to trans people. At the personal behest of a former Trump lawyer, he appears to have quickly reinstated the account of a far-right GOP candidate in Arizona — who immediately tweeted antisemitic comments and support for insurrectionists.

Meanwhile, to help service the debt Musk made Twitter take on, the new boss wants to make Twitter "blue check" verification marks a thing you can just buy — and have to keep paying for — at $20 a month. It's a disastrous proposal, as users keep telling Musk. The problem isn't having a premium tier of Twitter (there already was one, Twitter Blue); it's that Musk utterly misunderstands what blue checks do. They prove organizations, officials, celebrities, and reporters in the most dangerous parts of the world are who they say they are. They stop identity theft shenanigans.

Musk wants to devalue blue checks to the point where they simply mean "I'm paying $20 a month." In what universe does that make business sense? Probably the same one where Trump Steaks were a savvy move.

Late on Halloween, Musk could actually be found haggling in the replies of the master of horror, Stephen King. The author said he'd quit the service on principle if the check was going to cost $20: "fuck that," said King, "they should pay me." His 7 million followers may well agree; King has dropped many a gem since arriving on the service in 2013, all for free.

Because that's the kind of place Twitter has been until now, a place for all kinds of creators to mix it up, share news, have fun, and endlessly entertain. You'd think a wannabe entertainer like Musk would get that, right? You'd think he'd at least make a show of respect for a globally-loved storyteller using his service?

Instead, Musk sounded like a character in a King short story, perhaps one titled The boy who missed the point. "How about $8?" he tweeted, and you could almost hear the rattling of a tin cup. "We need to pay the bills somehow," Musk pleaded, promising to "explain the rationale" at a later date. "Twitter cannot entirely rely on advertisers."

He's right about that, especially now — because advertisers are feeling as frosty as King. General Motors suspended Twitter ads on Friday. According to The Information, Musk spent Monday in New York wooing the big accounts. But the big accounts, worth up to $100 million apiece of Twitter ad buys, are being advised by media buyers to hit pause on their Twitter campaigns until they can figure out what the hell is going on.

Twitter's ad revenue, last we heard, was $1.1 billion per quarter and falling slowly. If anything, Musk's busy week has accelerated the decline. Oh, and provided a fresh opportunity for phishing scams.

What's the goal? What's the end game? Control the conversation or troll it? Prepare Twitter for take-off or deliberately crash it? Is he going to let Trump back on Twitter, perhaps just in time for the midterm elections — the ultimate MAGA dominance move — or does he want to be the new Trump himself?

And what exactly are we dealing with here? Is this an intuitive business genius, or a puerile bro who lucked into his position with daddy's money and has no clue how to run a media company? Is Musk playing 5-D chess, or is his supposed plan just a mess of random impulses?

What's the goal? What's the end game? Control the conversation or troll it?

These are seductive questions, and I'm as guilty as anyone of hosting that endless debate in my head. There is much to be said about Musk's pet philosophy, longtermism, but that's for another time. Because here's the thing: ultimately these are the same questions we asked about Trump.

Have we forgotten the lessons of living through that administration while being very online? At a certain point, we learned to stop asking them and just let history judge, because it didn't matter in the moment. What mattered was the work. What mattered was resisting and reversing the mess he was making, the democratic norms he was shredding, as much as possible.

What mattered was not being distracted by the daily outrage from an overarching goal — that of making the world seem sane again.

In retrospect, it's obvious that Musk and Trump had the same skill set all along. They're both thin-skinned carnival barkers who like to shout about myriad future plans, few of which actually arrived. They both like to say and tweet whatever comes into their head. They both love Twitter because it let them only hear conclusions that reinforced their preexisting opinions; over time, that built them an echo chamber the size of Trump Tower and/or Starship.

There is, of course, a difference in magnitude. Musk hasn't mustered his stan army to attack the Capitol, at least not yet. But if he's taken chaotic evil lessons from the Trump era, if he believes that deliberate idiocy and distraction will mask any kind of plan — that trolls achieve goals — then we have reason to be worried indeed.

Even so, don't be afraid to strike a balance between being informed and taking necessary R&R; self-care is and always has been a political act. Which means we have more reason than ever to listen to doomscrolling reminders.

Well it's been a dramatic week on Twitter, and that's saying something.

It's only been a few days since Elon Musk acquired Twitter for real, but it already feels like oh so much longer than that. We've since seen top execs fired, bad sink puns, Musk casually spitballing over whether or not to bring back Vine with MrBeast, and the possible introduction of a $20 a month fee to keep your little blue tick intact.

As you can imagine, the responses to that ranged from jokes to outrage. One of those in the latter category was horror author Stephen King, who made his feelings on the subject fairly clear.

"$20 a month to keep my blue check? Fuck that, they should pay me." wrote King. "If that gets instituted, I’m gone like Enron."

Musk, clearly struggling between the pull of a new revenue stream and the fear of pushing celebs off his platform, responded late Monday night.

"We need to pay the bills somehow!" he wrote. "Twitter cannot rely entirely on advertisers. How about $8?"

The new Twitter owner then followed it up by saying it's "the only way to defeat bots & trolls," and that he'd explain the rationale in longer form before it's implemented.

King has yet to respond, but we'll update this story if he does. The two have previously shared a fairly cheery exchange about King's Tesla, so you never know.

If you thought Bayonetta 3, with its novel censorship mode, was the first series entry you could play around your little ones, think again.

As one of the more risqué franchises in Nintendo’s (and Sega's) back pocket, Bayonetta has always lived in a pretty weird space. It’s a game from a company you typically associate with family-friendliness, but it’s about a witch whose clothes constantly fall off her body while she shoots demons and angels with guns in her high heels. While I recognize that every family sets its own parameters for what media is acceptable, generally speaking, Bayonetta isn't a wholesome, fun-for-all-ages romp like Mario.

Bayonetta 3, the latest from series developer Platinum Games, tries to fix this with what it calls “Naive Angel” mode; a mode which censors in-game images to be more presentable to those who you otherwise wouldn’t want to see them. However, Naive Angel mode is mostly a weird half-step towards general audience acceptability that doesn't quite achieve its censorship goal while simultaneously robbing this Nintendo Switch exclusive of its distinctive soul.

What the heck is “Naive Angel”?

In every Bayonetta game, the titular gun-toting witch has a bevy of special moves that cause her to lose her clothing, which is also her hair. (Long story. Don't ask.) Cutscenes, of which there are many, frequently zoom in suggestively on her anatomy, too. This provocative approach is pretty much the DNA of the series.

I am not here, however, to debate whether or not this portrayal of Bayonetta is morally right — some find it sexist, while others find it empowering. I’ll just point out that plenty of folks justifiably see Bayonetta as a queer icon .

Regardless of how you feel about it as a player, there’s always the possibility that someone else could walk into the room, see what you’re playing, and not be entirely thrilled about it. Naive Angel mode is for those people. In this mode, which is accessible from the options menu, Bayonetta is more buttoned up — she no longer disrobes during special attacks, covered only by detailed animations that artfully conceal her private bits.

But when it comes to Bayonetta's roster of demon friends she can summon in battles, this PG-13 treatment only sort of applies.

For instance, in Naive Angel mode, her demon summon Madama Butterfly’s clothes are slightly less revealing in the chest area, as you can see in the YouTube channel GameXplain’s comparison video . She's essentially just wearing different lingerie. The difference is marginal to the point where you can barely notice it, which is a theme with Naive Angel mode.

That said, the mode did get a big laugh out of me in one of the opening cutscenes. Bayonetta's friend Rodin shows up smoking a cigar, which, in Naive Angel mode, has been hilariously replaced by a sort of chocolate-and-sprinkles-covered stick.

Sterile style

Naive Angel mode is a valiant effort by Platinum Games, I suppose, but it’s caught between doing too little and doing too much.

By “doing too little,” I mean this isn’t really a sanitized version of Bayonetta 3. The word "bullshit" makes an early appearance and the camera still captures close-up shots of Bayonetta's body; she's just wearing more clothes most of the time. You won’t see the brief and mostly implied bits of nudity that the series has always had, but you’ll get almost everything else.

You know, kid-friendly dialogue! Credit: Nintendo

And “by doing too much,” I feel that Naive Angel mode saps some of the soul out of what is otherwise a joyous experience. Bayonetta has always had style for days, with screen-filling bosses, cities being warped out of shape by demonic magic, catchy dance music, and a flair for fashion that you don’t get out of other action games like Devil May Cry. Your senses are being overloaded at all times on purpose.

It’s camp and I love it.

Maybe you don’t see it that way and you’d rather play a game without some of the more “inappropriate” bits, but even then you’d have to acknowledge that those bits are inextricably part of what Bayonetta has always been. While playing the opening chapters of the new game with Naive Angel mode turned on, I found myself noticing that something was just...off. It almost felt unfinished.

After disabling it and seeing the action play out as the developers intended, I realized what was going on: Theatrics. Bayonetta's hair shapeshifting into clothes or even forming giant demon monsters is a key part of the premise, and it always has a lot of visual flair. Those animations combine with lively theme songs to make everything really sing. It's jazz hands in video game form.

Without that element, the game just feels a little more empty than it should.

Maybe Naive Angel mode fits exactly into what your family considers appropriate for kids or otherwise. For my money, though, its half-baked censorship of things that maybe shouldn't be censored at all ultimately feels a little disrespectful to Bayonetta herself.

No, you haven't died of dysentery: The Oregon Trail is coming to Nintendo Switch.

Publisher Gameloft announced the news on Tuesday, saying an updated version of the beloved computer lab session game will be available for PC via Steam, the Microsoft Store, and Nintendo at the end of November.

According to the Steam listing, Gameloft's The Oregon Trail is a successor to the original game and promises "a modern twist on the trials and tribulations of the road to Oregon." The game will feature 15 playable journeys and seven quests inspired by historical events, and "immerse players in exhilarating journeys ranging from the historically accurate to the totally extreme," according to the publisher.

The aim of the game is the same as always: get your party safely across the American frontier to Oregon before winter. Every choice you make counts toward the outcome: you'll need to build your party with different skill levels, personalities, and from different classes, then monitor the health, morale, stamina, and hygiene of your party, and manage your wagon's inventory and prevent breakdowns, and take care of your oxen. Plus, you'll meet people and study animals along the trail.

The hunting and rafting elements will return as well as all the classic hazards — broken limbs, river fording, transporting gunpowder through the desert, blizzards, snakebites, starvation, exhaustion, and yes, dysentery — and there'll be a new fishing minigame with over 80 species.

There's no specific release date for the game just yet, but Gameloft specified November, so you can expect it within the next few weeks. In the meantime, try the millennial version of The Oregon Trail (really).

Tech is everything and everywhere nowadays. The world online and the world offline have fully blended together, which means most folks have so much tech in their lives. Cords and screens, controllers and batteries, endless chargers, massive amounts of data, and hundreds of tabs open at once.

With the holiday season coming up, it's a great idea to gift loved ones the tools they need to organize their tech. If tech touches all parts of lives, then it's important to keep our lives organized. Here are 12 gift ideas for the in-need-or-organization techie person in your life.

1. Air Tags

Apple Air Tags are literally made for organization and keep track of things. Starting at $29, you can gift a loved one the peace-of-mind of never losing an item. Air Tags basically let you ping a device or thing and see exactly where you left it. Mashable's review of the Air Tag notes that they work extremely well, even if that can raise privacy concerns for some folks.

2. The non-Apple version of the Air Tag

Not everyone is an Apple person. For the Android or otherwise folks, you could gift them a Tile tracker or a Samsung Galaxy SmartTag.

3. Cord organizers

The modern techie dilemma: what to do with all those cords? If you have a million devices and gadgets, then you have something like two million cords lying around or hanging about the house. Cable straps from Amazon for $9.99 would be a fantastic stocking stuffer.

4. A travel accessory bag

When you're on the go it's hard to keep things in place. A travel pack for your tech-focused items makes all the difference. This $49.95 option from Incase has a pocket for your phone, straps to keep cords in place, and mesh pockets for headphones and other small items.

5. Subscription manager

The tech-focused person in your life might have so many subscriptions that they forget some even exist. A service like Rocket Money (up until very recently called Truebill) promises to find all your subscriptions and help cancel ones you no longer use. You could gift a premium membership with Rocket Money, which range from $3-12 per month.

6. Portable power block

Having a bunch of devices can be a burden. You've got to make sure they're all charged and sometimes you just...forget. A charging brick might be the just the thing to gift to someone who loves tech. You can pick up this Anker portable charger for just $21.99.

Welcome to Fix It , our series examining film and TV projects we love — save for one tiny change we wish we could make.

Starting with The Witcher Season 4, Henry Cavill will no longer play Geralt of Rivia. Instead, Liam Hemsworth will be taking up the mantle of the White Wolf.

The news, announced on Oct. 29, is earth-shattering for fans of the Netflix fantasy series based on the books by Andrzej Sapkowski. Cavill's performance hewed closely to the Geralt of the Witcher video games, and he had a clear love and respect for the source material. His departure after Season 3 — likely due to his return to the role of Superman in the DCEU — will no doubt feel strange, even if Hemsworth's performance is top notch.

Season 4 of The Witcher may still be a while aways, but the worst thing it could do is treat the new casting like it's business as usual. This isn't a House of the Dragon time jump situation where we need new actors because a character has aged up — this is a full-on replacement of the lead. The Witcher needs to find some way to maintain its fans' trust after such a big change, and the solution may very well be leaning into the strangeness of the entire situation. That's right: It's time for The Witcher to get meta.

It's time for 'The Witcher' to get meta.

Of course, it may be difficult for the show to poke meta fun at itself while maintaining its tone. We can't have Hemsworth turning to camera and going, "I bet you're wondering how I ended up here," but we can't have The Witcher stay completely silent on the matter either. Luckily for us, The Witcher has a secret comedic weapon: bard Jaskier (Joey Batey).

Heal us with song, Jaskier. Credit: Susie Allnutt

Throughout both seasons of The Witcher (and presumably Season 3), Jaskier has constructed songs about Geralt's exploits, as well as eternal break-up banger "Burn Butcher Burn." These are meta-narratives in themselves, as Jaskier's glowing portrayal of Geralt often embellishes matters or leaves out some of his adventures' less savory details. Perhaps a song acknowledging that Geralt looks different is in order. If anyone could write a whole bop about Geralt, say, getting a haircut, it would be Jaskier.

Jaskier is also proof that The Witcher is able to get meta if it so chooses. In a scene in Season 2, a fan of Jaskier tells him he didn't enjoy his songs' multiple timelines: a common fan complaint about Season 1. Along those lines, The Witcher could use a song to get ahead of its audience's apprehension about the Geralt switch. It's a way of saying, "We totally understand that it's weird."

Featured Video For You Henry Cavill dug deep into 'The Witcher' games and fantasy fiction to get his Geralt just right

Best of all, this method of acknowledging recasting through meta song has already been used before with great results in the CW's musical comedy Crazy Ex-Girlfriend. And yes, I know that The Witcher and Crazy Ex-Girlfriend occupy very different spaces in the TV landscape, but hear me out!

Season 4 of Crazy Ex-Girlfriend saw the return of fan-favorite character Greg, played in Seasons 1 and 2 by Santino Fontana and in Season 4 by Skylar Astin. When main character Rebecca Bunch (Rachel Bloom) meets "new" Greg, the two sing a duet called "Hello, Nice to Meet You," pretending to meet again for the first time while also reminiscing about their shared history. It's a perfect, witty riff on meet-cutes and the awkwardness of seeing a character you've grown to love embodied by a new actor.

I would never expect The Witcher to lean as hard into meta-comedy as Crazy Ex-Girlfriend did, because that would not be in keeping with the show's tone. However, Jaskier's meta-songs have set somewhat of a precedent and could be an important tool to help fans get accustomed to Hemsworth's portrayal. So get to writing, bard! We'll all miss Cavill, but a good song may very well help ease the pain.

You can no longer favorite a TikTok in peace.

Earlier this month, TikTok made an update that notifies creators when someone favorites their video on the app. This means your favorites aren't as anonymous as they used to be, which frankly sucks the fun out of the favorites feature. Previously, creators could only see the number of favorites a video had but not the users who favorited it, making it possible to lurk and like content without being perceived. Other social media apps with similar features, like Twitter's Bookmarks and Instagram's Saved, don't notify creators when someone favorites their videos.

"We're always thinking about ways to add value to the community and enrich the TikTok experience, as we continue to build a safe place that entertains, inspires creativity, and drives culture," a TikTok spokesperson told Mashable. "With Favorites notifications, we're exploring new methods for deeper community engagement and creator analytics."

While this new feature may be helpful for creators, it's making more passive TikTok consumers like myself second-guess before favoriting someone's content.

A favorite feels so much more intimate than a like because there is the implication that I liked the video so much that I'll be returning to it later. It's a step further than a like, and therefore knowing the creator can see I favorited their video is a little bit humiliating. The anxiety just isn't worth it.

Previously, favorites was my favorite function on the app, thanks to Collections. In February, TikTok launched Collections, which allows users to organize their favorites into folders. The feature revolutionized the favorites feature and made it so much more useful. Gen Z uses Collections like Pinterest, returning to the app for cooking, travel, and shopping inspiration.

At this time, TikTok has no plans for future updates to favorites, but something about this decision feels like a larger shift on the app. It signifies a turn towards less user anonymity on the platform. In June, TikTok debuted Profile Views, a function that allows users to see who has viewed their profile.

TikTok no longer feels like a weird little corner of the internet, a place where you can passively engage with content tailored to your interests; with these updates, it's starting to feel like a place of surveillance.

It's a step further than a like, and therefore knowing the creator can see I favorited their video is a little bit humiliating. The anxiety just isn't worth it.

Previously, favorites was my favorite function on the app, thanks to Collections. In February, TikTok launched Collections, which allows users to organize their favorites into folders. The feature revolutionized the favorites feature and made it so much more useful. Gen Z uses Collections like Pinterest, returning to the app for cooking, travel, and shopping inspiration.

At this time, TikTok has no plans for future updates to favorites, but something about this decision feels like a larger shift on the app. It signifies a turn towards less user anonymity on the platform. In June, TikTok debuted Profile Views, a function that allows users to see who has viewed their profile.

TikTok no longer feels like a weird little corner of the internet, a place where you can passively engage with content tailored to your interests; with these updates, it's starting to feel like a place of surveillance.

It seems everyone uses Google's free services. Its search engine is the most-trafficked website in the world. Over a billion people depend on Gmail for their email messaging. Google Meet provides multi-user remote video conferencing at absolutely no cost.

And more and more bad actors are utilizing Google Sites to defraud and scam internet users everyday. Wait…what?

Google has a problem. While its free services are great at making online tools more accessible to people around the globe, they also give scammers an easy way to set up shop. Without having to unveil their identities via credit card or billing address to make a payment, fraudsters can easily weaponize these products to carry out their scams.

Most people are familiar with products like Gmail and Google Meet and know that anyone can use these services. But Google Sites is a much lesser-known service. And the Google Sites service, which allows users to create web pages, provides a huge assist to scammers looking to hide under a veil of trustworthiness: a website under the Google.com domain name.

"On Google Sites, we explicitly prohibit phishing and we invest heavily in detecting, deterring, and removing abuse from our platforms,” said a Google spokesperson in a statement provided to Mashable.

Google is aware of the issue. However, the scams enabled by Google Sites persist. And they are not hard to find.

Google Gone Phishing

Phishing is a classic online scam tactic in which a bad actor copies the web designs of trusted websites, like a user's bank, in order to trick the individual into inputting their sensitive information so the scammer can access it. These scammers have found success creating these phishing websites on Google Sites.

"I first encountered this scam myself whilst looking on Google for 'Google Ads,'" SEO consultant Matt Tutt said to Mashable.

Tutt had previously written about his own personal experience coming across the Google Sites scams in 2020 . Like many people, Tutt decided to just Google the website he wanted to visit instead of directly typing the URL in his web browser's address bar. He clicked the first link — a Google ad — on the search results page, assuming it would be the official Google Ads website.

"It looked fairly legit, and honestly, I probably had my guard down, as I'd not have imagined someone apart from Google could run ads for the keyword 'Google Ads,'" he explained. "I was presented with the standard Google Ads homepage — or at least I thought I was! When I went to log in, I noticed the URL was slightly different, and that's when it struck me: I wasn't on the official Google Ads site."

"Luckily, I hadn't entered my login credentials, but it struck me how easily I was nearly fooled, considering I work as an SEO specialist and have done so for over 10 years!" Tutt continued.

If he had entered his password on that fake Google Ads page, he would have sent his credentials directly to a scammer. And if these Google Sites phishing pages could nearly trick a professional who works in search, like Tutt, there's a good chance scammers are succeeding with less savvy individuals.

The problem is that every page published with Google Sites is accessible under the URL structure "sites.google.com." And, from cybersecurity experts to tech-savvy family members, anyone who's ever tried to educate people on how to avoid phishing scams has always stressed the importance of looking at the URL. If it isn't one you trust, you shouldn't click, nor should you provide any sensitive information on the page. It is a very good tip. But scammers are constantly evolving. Over the years, they have upgraded their tactics and have weaponized subdomains, like "YourBank.ScammersDomain.com." In turn, users have specifically been told to look for the word right before the domain extension ".com." If it's unfamiliar to you, you probably shouldn't trust it.

But every user-generated webpage published with Google Sites is accessible via the "sites.google.com" URL. Even a scammer's phishing website, which may go by "sites.google.com/yourbank." The main keyword right before the ".com" is Google, right? The mega Big Tech corporation. The world's largest search engine. The most popular website on earth. If that's not a trustworthy domain, then nothing could be, right? And that's why scammers love Google Sites.

Direct-to-Consumer Scams

The scammer that almost fooled SEO consultant Tutt displayed some serious bravado in targeting those who were likely more tech-savvy than most. But most of these Google Site scammers have their sites set on much easier targets.

I first came across just how bad the Google Sites scams had become when a family member fell victim to one. Looking to activate YouTube on their television , a relative Google-searched the YouTube TV activation URL instead of inputting it into the web browser directly. A Google Sites phishing page popped up on the first page of Google, mimicking the look of an official YouTube site. In my investigation, I saw just how high Google was ranking a phishing site on the first page for a search query of their own sister company, YouTube. Because Google ranks Google Sites pages highly, these phishing pages enjoy prime spots for many related search terms.

The site instructed the family member to input the provided code to activate YouTube on their television. Of course, it didn't work. The Google Site was set up for that to happen. The scam website then informed my family member that they needed to call a telephone number to activate YouTube on their TV. When they called the number, they were connected directly to a scammer who was able to scam them out of hundreds of dollars in the belief that these were small, temporary charges that were only used to confirm activation of their YouTube account on their TV set.

Since that piece was published last year, I have heard from a handful of readers who have fallen for similar scams utilizing Google Sites, such as one that scammed users looking to activate Amazon's Prime Video .

In 2020, the cybersecurity firm Armorblox released a report about a growing phenomenon: Scammers weaponizing free Google services like Google Docs, Google Form, and, of course, Google Sites.

From American Express to Microsoft Teams to a targets' payroll provider, Armorblox sussed out a slew of various brand impersonation phishing schemes using these free services like Google Sites.

"​​Though Google…[does] remove many of these, they are slow to respond to emerging attacks, leaving the attacker with days, if not weeks, to launch attacks," Armblox chief information security officer Brian Johnson said to Mashable. "The game of Whac-A-mMole to get these taken down is a neverending battle."

While the free nature of Google Sites and the cloak of the Google.com domain are huge factors in why they attract bad actors, there are more technical reasons, too.

"Due to these URLs and domains being used for several legitimate purposes, native email security filters are unlikely to block these inherently trustworthy links," explained Johnson.

Plus, Johnson says, when Google does get around to taking down a phishing website, the scammer can quickly get everything back up and running.

"They make it so easy to use and throw and set up another account again," he continued. "This allows attackers to keep launching a steady stream of attacks even when they are taken down."

What's next? Crypto scams, of course!

While Google has responded to Google Sites scams and shut down many phishing pages, that has not deterred scammers. And it may not be all that shocking to find where these bad actors are seeing money signs next: Cryptocurrency.

A new report from cybersecurity company Netskope found that throughout this past year, scammers are weaponizing Google Sites pages in order to steal people's crypto wallet and account credentials from platforms like MetaMask and Coinbase.

The report by Netskope provides an example of a Google Sites phishing page besides the MetaMask homepage it has copied. Credit: Netskope

These scams work pretty much the same way other Google Sites scams work. The scammer creates a page that looks like the MetaMask or Coinbase login page; it provides users with the option of providing their username and password or secret recovery phrase to log in. Of course, once the user inputs that information, they are not actually logging into their crypto wallet or crypto exchange account. They are simply handing their account information over to the scammer.

One interesting difference noted by Netskope: With the crypto-related Google Sites scams, the scammers are very proactive. In prior Google Sites phishing schemes, most scammers seemed to sit back and let Google Search provide them with unlimited fresh targets, willingly inputting their private information or calling fake support numbers. Netskope's report found that many crypto scam Google Sites pages are actually being scammed on blogs and social media posts around the web.

Be on the lookout for that "sites" subdomain before the "Google.com" URL the next time you come across a webpage that looks to be from the most trustworthy domain name on earth. It just might be a scammer.

If Quordle is a little too challenging today, you've come to the right place for hints. There aren't just hints here, but the whole Quordle solution. Scroll to the bottom of this page, and there it is. But are you sure you need all four answers? Maybe you just need a strategy guide. Either way, scroll down, and you'll get what you need.

What is Quordle?

Quordle is a five-letter word guessing game similar to Wordle, except each guess applies letters to four words at the same time. You get nine guesses instead of six to correctly guess all four words. It looks like playing four Wordle games at the same time, and that is essentially what it is. But it's not nearly as intimidating as it sounds.

Is Quordle harder than Wordle?

Yes, though not diabolically so.

Where did Quordle come from?

Amid the Wordle boom of late 2021 and early 2022, when everyone was learning to love free, in-browser, once-a-day word guessing games, creator Freddie Meyer says he took inspiration from one of the first big Wordle variations, Dordle — the one where you essentially play two Wordles at once. He took things up a notch, and released Quordle on January 30. Meyer's creation was covered in The Guardian six days later, and now, according to Meyer, it attracts millions of daily users. Today, Meyer earns modest revenue from Patreon, where dedicated Quordle fans can donate to keep their favorite puzzle game running.

How is Quordle pronounced?

“Kwordle.” It should rhyme with “Wordle,” and definitely should not be pronounced exactly like "curdle.”

Is Quordle strategy different from Wordle?

Yes and no.

Your starting strategy should be the same as with Wordle. In fact, if you have a favorite Wordle opening word, there’s no reason to change that here. We suggest something rich in vowels, featuring common letters like C, R, and N. But you do you.

After your first guess, however, you’ll notice things getting out of control if you play Quordle exactly like Wordle.

What should I do in Quordle that I don’t do in Wordle?

Solving a Wordle puzzle can famously come down to a series of single letter-change variations. If you’ve narrowed it down to “-IGHT,” you could guess “MIGHT” “NIGHT” “LIGHT” and “SIGHT” and one of those will probably be the solution — though this is also a famous way to end up losing in Wordle, particularly if you play on “hard mode.” In Quordle, however, this sort of single-letter winnowing is a deadly trap, and it hints at the important strategic difference between Wordle and Quordle: In Quordle, you can't afford to waste guesses unless you're eliminating as many letters as possible at all times.

Guessing a completely random word that you already know isn't the solution, just to eliminate three or four possible letters you haven’t tried yet, is thought of as a desperate, latch-ditch move in Wordle. In Quordle, however, it's a normal part of the player's strategic toolset.

Is there a way to get the answer faster?

In my experience Quordle can be a slow game, sometimes dragging out longer than it would take to play Wordle four times. But a sort of blunt-force guessing approach can speed things up. The following strategy also works with Wordle if you only want the solution, and don’t care about having the fewest possible guesses:

Try starting with a series of words that puts all the vowels (including Y) on the board, along with some other common letters. We've had good luck with the three words: “NOTES,” “ACRID,” and “LUMPY.” YouTuber DougMansLand suggests four words: “CANOE,” “SKIRT,” “PLUMB,” and “FUDGY.”

Most of the alphabet is now eliminated, and you’ll only have the ability to make one or two wrong guesses if you use this strategy. But in most cases you’ll have all the information you need to guess the remaining words without any wrong guesses.

If strategy isn't helping, and you're still stumped, here are some hints:

Are there any double or triple letters in today’s Quordle words?

Two words have letters that occur twice.

Are any rare letters being used in today’s Quordle like Q or Z?

No.

What do today’s Quordle words start with?

C, M, A, and S.

What are the answers for today’s Quordle?

Are you sure you want to know?

There’s still time to turn back.

OK, you asked for it. The answers are:

Spooky season is over, Mariah season has begun, and today is the 500th Wordle! It was around this time last year that Josh Wardle's puzzle game began to pick up steam online, soon becoming a daily habit for thousands and then hundreds of thousands. Whether your streak's solidly in the multiple-hundreds today or you're a regular X/6er doing your best, we're here to help with handy hints, as we do every day.

If you just want today's word, you can jump straight to the end of this article for November 1's Wordle solution, for puzzle #500. If you'd rather work through it yourself, keep reading for some tips, tricks, and clues.

Where did Wordle come from?

Wordle was initially created by engineer Josh Wardle as a gift for his partner, though it quickly spread until it became an international phenomenon. Thousands of players across the globe tackle Wordle each day, with some fans even having created alternate versions of the daily word puzzle game. These include battle royale format Squabble, music identification game Heardle, and variations like Dordle and Quordle that make you guess multiple words at once.

The popularity of Wordle even reached such heights that the New York Times bought it earlier this year, while TikTok creators live-stream themselves playing it.

What's the best Wordle starting word?

The goal of Wordle is to have fun, and there's no right way to have fun. Just choose whatever starting word feels right to you, and don't let anyone shame you for it. However, if you want to take a more strategic approach, we have a few ideas to help you pick a word that will spark joy. One tip is to select a word that includes at least two different vowels, plus some common consonants like S, T, R, or N.

What happened to the Wordle archive?

The entire archive of past Wordles used to be available for anyone to play in glorious days gone by. Unfortunately it has since been taken down, with the website's creator stating it was done at the request of the New York Times.

Is Wordle getting harder?

If you're finding Wordle too easy, you can try enabling its Hard Mode to give your brain a tougher challenge. But Wordle isn't getting any harder by itself — it's the same difficulty that it's always been.

Why are there two different Wordle answers some days?

Wordle is a fun, collective experience specifically because everyone's solving for the same word every day. Occasionally, though, Wordle has accepted two different solutions as correct on the same day. This is because the New York Times made changes to the Wordle word list after acquiring it, and sometimes swaps out words from the original list. To ensure you're getting the right answer every day, refresh your browser before you play — the site will save your streak.

Here's a subtle hint for today's Wordle answer:

It's one of the scents of the season.

Does today's Wordle answer have a double letter?

Nope!

Today's Wordle is a 5-letter word that ends with...

The letter... Y. (Yup, the same as yesterday!)

What's the answer to Wordle today?

Get your guesses in — it's the last call before we reveal the answer to today's Wordle!

Are you ready?

"This is a little strange, I am sure," began the letter Jessi Zahm, of Newberg, Oregon, found on her doorstep this September, "but we live up the street from you and we drive by your house daily."

Zahm had a secret admirer — or rather, one of her Halloween decorations did.

"My daughter who is 3 started a new daycare which has been a struggle," the letter continued. "We have a new routine after I pick her up, we grab dairy queen and then she asks to go see the big skeleton to tell it about her day... Seeing how happy it makes my daughter who was in tears hours earlier [...] makes driving around the block 6 times to move for all the cars worth it."

The skeleton the note referred to, of course, is the $299 "12 ft Giant-Sized Skeleton with LifeEyes™️ LCD Eyes,"(opens in a new tab) a bestselling and highly sought-after decoration from Home Depot's seasonal department.

The prop holds a special place in Zahm's own heart. She goes all-out for Halloween and got her first of two skeletons in September after pining over it for years — a conquest that involved waking up early before work and waiting outside her local Home Depot the day it set out Halloween decorations for the season, she told Mashable in an email. (She now refers to it as "John Skellerman.") But the letter came as a surprise.

"We got misty-eyed," Zahm said. "We never thought someone would love him as much as we do."

Zahm's experience encapsulates a collective and persistent infatuation with the Home Depot skeleton, which originally debuted to rabid fanfare in the fall of 2020. It was the gaunt face that launched a thousand memes and a driving force behind the retailer's " most successful Halloween " to date that year, Home Depot's Chief Operating Officer Ted Decker said in an interview with CNBC , despite a significant dip in holiday spending and participation at the time.

The skeleton might have easily been a pandemic fluke — nothing more than a silly distraction or a temporary salve to societal upheaval. As anyone who bought a Peloton at the peak of its popularity can tell you, people's minds were operating on a different plane in 2020.

Yet even years later, as Zahm could attest, securing a Home Depot skeleton when it gets a rare "Limit 1 per order" drop in 2022 requires luck, timing, and maybe knowing a guy who knows a guy. This year's June and July online restocks both saw the skeleton sell out rapidly, with the former contributing to the highest quarterly earnings in Home Depot history. And aside from a few random reappearances , it's been MIA ever since — scroll through the comments section on its product page for a taste of many wannabe buyers' woes.

Scammers and resellers have gotten in on the action, too, targeting the skeleton as if it were a next-generation gaming console or a limited-edition sneaker. Listings on resale platforms like Facebook Marketplace and eBay ask hundreds of dollars over retail price.

I set like 10 alarms because I was like, 'What if he sells out?'

Consumer response to the skeleton has been so immense that Home Depot decided to add more giant Halloween decorations to its lineup, according to Senior Merchant of Decorative Holiday Lance Allen, who affectionately calls the prop "Skelly." (For the record, Allen said the skeleton uses whatever pronouns buyers deem fit. A gender-fluid icon .) First was the 2021 release of a 12-foot Inferno Pumpkin Skeleton (opens in a new tab), a "spicy," corpsey cousin for the classic model priced at $379. This year's additions included a 15-foot Towering Phantom (opens in a new tab), a 12-foot Hovering Witch (opens in a new tab), and a 9.5-foot Immortal Werewolf (opens in a new tab), which went for $299 to $399 apiece.

Like any good viral sensation , the original Home Depot skeleton also spawned copycats at other stores. Lowe's , Walmart (opens in a new tab), Best Buy (opens in a new tab), Costco , and JOANN Fabrics have all sought to ride the Big Skeleton wave in 2022. A suspiciously decent knockoff on Amazon (opens in a new tab) was sold out at the time of publication, having been listed between $325.95 to $1,999.99. (To quote one customer's five-star review: "He is big!!!!")

In a way, the Home Depot skeleton was destined to be a hit. Its 60 pounds of beige high-density polyethylene stand at an imposing 12 feet — technically 11.7, if you go by the specifications on its online listing. Its two blue-green animated LifeEyes call to mind a certain Miley Cyrus meme while slow-blinking into space, as if it were trying to bond with onlookers. It's weatherproof. It's semi-posable. It takes two human adults approximately one hour to assemble. It could hypothetically go through airport security. It's massive. Its potency as a meme is undeniable.

"I think 'too absurd to fail' is a great way to put it," said Anthony DiMieri, a New York City-based writer, director, and producer. Self-described as "way too online," he turned horny tweets about the Home Depot skeleton into "My New Boyfriend," a 2021 short film satirizing the modern dating scene that stars our tall king as a love interest. (It would have come out sooner, but all the Home Depot skeletons DiMieri could find on eBay in 2020 were marked up four times retail price.) The mere phrase "12-foot skeleton from Home Depot" is comedy gold in its specificity and strangeness, he explained.

Scarcity as a self-fulfilling prophecy has also contributed to the skeleton's runaway success, compounded by the fact that its price hasn't increased in its three years on the market — even after Home Depot started including a plug-in power adapter in 2021. Concerns that the skeleton would get more expensive this year because of record-high inflation motivated Lindsey Wilcox, of Warner Robins, Georgia, to finally coordinate a purchase with her boyfriend and best friend; they wound up financing it with a Klarna payment plan .

"I was really nervous about it," Wilcox told Mashable. "I set like 10 alarms because I was like, 'What if he sells out?'" The upper half of her skeleton has a permanent home as part of the TV stand, now the focal point of her apartment.

But something about the skeleton's staying power continues to confound. The number of viral products that have faded into obscurity as soon as the next big thing trends is incalculable — something new should have usurped its throne by now. (The jacked werewolf tried its best ; Home Depot had it on clearance at the time of publication.) Yet the skeleton has returned with gusto in the summers and falls since its inception, like a marigold bloom, indoctrinating new generations of skele-sciples. It's almost as if this supersized symbol of death has taken on a life of its own.

Fear factor

Most of my reporting on this story was driven by a journalistic need for answers to the whys and hows of this viral trend, but I'd be remiss if I didn't disclose a deeply personal quest to confront a lifelong phobia.

Growing up, I remember ordering my three younger sisters to say "SK" in place of "skeleton" because the word alone scared me. The Hunchback of Notre Dame, The Nightmare Before Christmas, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, and FernGully: The Last Rainforest were all banned from family movie nights because of skeleton cameos. I can't touch anything that has a skeleton on it, whether it's a T-shirt or the cover of an anatomy book. I have spent the past three decades trying to ignore the fact that there is one under my own skin right now — you don't need to remind me. (Please do not remind me.)

In mid-September 2022, after I'd had several lovely conversations with 12-foot skeleton owners from around the country, a tweet alerted me to the fact that my local Home Depot in Chicago's Lincoln Park neighborhood had one on display. I felt a moral obligation to see this thing after everything I'd heard and read. (My colleagues at Mashable have covered restocks , dupes , and the Inferno Pumpkin launch .) At the very least, I could use the trip as an excuse to grab a hot dog after work.

After I stepped off the parking garage's industrial elevator and rounded a pallet of blue windshield washer fluid, there it was — in the center of the floor, smack dab between the escalators leading to and from the appliance and paint departments, with a homemade sign attached to its wrist that said, "PLEASE DO NOT TOUCH SKELETON."

I wish I could call our encounter a personal reckoning, a watershed moment of clarity, or a healing round of exposure therapy. Faint feelings of familiarity and "wow, so this is the guy!" were percolating somewhere. But mostly I was just freaked out. I did not feel well in its presence, much less a desire to make physical contact. It was simply too big, too spooky, too skeleton-y.

Getting close enough for a decent photo I could send to the family group chat was physically distressing — "is that the 12 foot sk," one sister texted back — but it did draw my eye to the small price tag next to the sign. In the interest of due diligence, I approached a nearby apron-clad associate to ask whether it was in stock.

"No," he answered sheepishly.

How long had it been sold out?

"About three weeks now."

A star is born

Every legend needs an origin story, and one side of the skeleton's goes largely untold. Despite being widely known as the Home Depot skeleton, it was actually developed in tandem with a tiny seasonal product design and consultancy business called Seasonal Visions International, which operates out of Berkeley and San Diego, Calif. A sister company called SVI Global Ltd. manufactures its products in China and sells them to retailers around the world.

Not that anyone would glean that from a Google search. SVI doesn't maintain any socials aside from a dormant Facebook page , and the closest it has to a website is a wiki within the Spirit Halloween Fandom community. The only traces of it on the Home Depot website are found within the Questions & Answers section of its products' listings, where "SVI Product Expert" responds to customer concerns.

This secrecy is intentional, according to a person deeply familiar with SVI who spoke to Mashable under the condition of anonymity: The company doesn't want to steal the spotlight from its retail partners. Other SVI-made decorations include Home Depot's new phantom, floating witch, and werewolf, as well as Best Buy's 8-foot Towering Skeleton with "Digieyes" (the non-trademarked version of LifeEyes). For its part, Home Depot told Mashable that SVI "has been a fantastic partner — they're true innovators in holiday products and décor."

As the store's Senior Merchant of Decorative Holiday, Allen is often touted as the skeleton's creator, having been inspired by a giant torso that appeared at trade shows and haunted houses in 2019. The prop was the result of trying to "bring customers innovation and quality that has never been available in a retail setting" while "[pushing] the limits with our engineer and manufacturing capabilities," Allen told Mashable in a statement.

Jazzing up an otherwise static decoration with moving, dilating LCD eyes was one way to accomplish that. But why 12 feet, specifically?

"The height of a [10-foot] basketball hoop seemed impressive, but we knew our team could do better," said Allen. "We decided on 12 feet because the image of two grown men standing on top of each other's heads seemed like it would be a showstopper!"

As cool as the skeleton seemed, the onset of the COVID pandemic in early 2020 had SVI worried about a Halloween season for the first time in its 19-year history, our source said. Would anyone be in the mood to celebrate? You don't have to be an economist to recognize the fact that extravagant decorations of the morbid and macabre were a hard sell at the time, especially in an economy upended by supply chain crises and a sharp decline in consumer spending. No one was hoarding an emergency fund for a $300 giant skeleton.

But people were, in fact, in the mood. SVI had never experienced such an enormous public response to one of its products before, which our source partially credited to word of mouth and a mention in the popular true crime podcast My Favorite Murder. Some people within the company kept scrapbooks.

Home Depot itself had a hunch the skeleton would be popular with its customers after it took off online that summer, said Allen, but no one there fully understood the magnitude of its stardom until it went on display in stores in August, when it "exploded overnight." Allen didn't explicitly confirm whether the skeleton was originally intended to be a one-time deal for 2020, but did note that Home Depot "wanted to ensure we continued to bring that excitement to our customers" after many missed out on its introduction. (The SVI source said its scarcity in 2020 and 2021 was the direct result of supply chain snags, which simmered down in time for the first 2022 restock.)

The skeleton opened many doors for SVI, which swiftly became a name among the Halloween decorating community. But none of its other products have had a bony grip on consumers quite like the original 12-footer.

Skelly die-hards

If there's an official fan club for the Home Depot skeleton, it lives on Facebook. Groups dedicated to the decoration have ballooned and multiplied over the past two years, in many cases amassing tens of thousands of members each. Conservative estimates for across-the-board totals would be well over the 100,000 mark.

These Facebook groups have become epicenters for all factions of the fandom, from hardcore Halloween people who decorate year-round to casuals who are just trying to have the spookiest yard on their block. They're gathering spaces where someone can revel in the triumph of finally buying a skeleton after a months- or yearslong hunt. They're virtual highlight reels for showing off displays, runways for outfit inspiration, and creative outlets for sharing modifications. (Metallic spray paints, skull-to-phalange glitter, and rustic wood stains were huge for SS22.) They're sounding boards for punny name ideas. They're fountains of wisdom on how to secure it properly, prevent it from getting stolen, or persuade a spouse to buy another. They're sources of empathy when hardships and natural disasters force a premature disassembly. They're war rooms for swapping tips on how to win over neighbors and homeowners associations.

The Home Depot skeleton has found itself in an infinite number of locations, outfits, and poses as a result of these Facebook groups, morphing into some sort of cross between Flat Stanley and a Midwestern porch goose . One does not simply own this thing; it joins your family. It gives you a story to tell at parties. To know the Home Depot skeleton is to love it — or at least feel a compulsion to talk about it.

"We are aware of the many fun groups and communities online and are so excited that The Home Depot fans have come together to celebrate our original giant, Skelly," said Allen. "We hope their enthusiasm will continue to extend to Skelly's friends and fellow giants."

Jennifer Penelope Corcoran, of Nashville, Tenn., is the mastermind behind 12 Ft Skeleton Halloween Club , a hub for "owners, soon-to-be owners, and admirers of the 12-foot skeleton to share pics, tips, and ideas." (Yes, they've made T-shirts.) She created the group on Sept. 5, 2020, having just bought a skeleton during a restock and seen people post about it in other holiday decorating forums. But she wasn't sure whether it would gain any traction.

Cut to the group's current membership count of over 50,000 people, the largest in the genre, which grows daily.

"It's completely happened by accident," said Corcoran, whose display now includes two Home Depot skeletons nicknamed Ray and Frankie Blue Eyes, an Inferno Pumpkin variant, the 12-foot witch, the 15-foot phantom, the 9.5-foot werewolf, a giant snake, various skeletal animals, some Haunted Mansion-inspired cutouts, and a 20-foot inflatable cat from Amazon she calls Princess Meow Meow. (As far as a theme goes, "it's really more lack of willpower than anything else," Corcoran joked.)

Corcoran told Mashable she found Home Depot's Allen on Facebook to invite him to the group shortly after its inception, only to discover he was already a member. A 2021 media preview was the start of her team's close working relationship with the retailer, which keeps close tabs on the community and flags upcoming restocks — intel it relays to members as "Code Orange" alerts as soon as drops go live.

"We'll email them about stuff all the time and they get back to us right away," said Corcoran of Home Depot, which invited her and Randy Motes, a co-admin from the Dallas-Fort Worth area, back for its in-person Halloween and holiday showcase in 2022. "They enjoy it, they enjoy seeing everybody's displays and the things people are doing with it…They're definitely fun to work with."

SVI is also embedded within 12 Ft Skeleton Halloween Club, though it tries to maintain a low profile. Corcoran described their relationship as a symbiotic one: Her team can put group members in touch with SVI for troubleshooting and replacement parts; in turn, SVI gets to see how customers are interacting with their products. Sometimes they'll send YouTube videos with setup tips and tricks, she added. "They want customers to be happy, too."

Serving as middlemen between these companies and consumers is just one facet of running 12 Ft Skeleton Halloween Club for Corcoran and her dedicated squad of 19 other admins and moderators; the rest involves a thoughtful balance of customer service, informal PR, and community-building. Post approval stays on to kill leaks, deter spam, and make sure members resell extras at cost. Threads are watched closely to ensure conversations stay civil and on-topic. Co-admin Motes tries to personally refresh the group's cover photo on a daily basis to showcase as many group members' skeletons as possible — though "I know I miss hundreds," he told Mashable. Each member of the team spends an average of 10 to 40 hours a week tending to the group, said Corcoran.

All this over a seasonal prop from a home improvement store? It's easy to see the appeal of Facebook groups dedicated to shared, hyper-specific interests at a time when online connections were lifelines. But most members of 12 Ft Skeleton Halloween Club would probably tell you it's evolved into something more.

The group parlayed its sense of community into a nationwide fundraising campaign during the 2021 Halloween season, raising over $150,000 for St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. Members rallied behind a family in Austin, Texas, whose Home Depot skeleton was stolen in broad daylight , offering to chip in for a replacement and even donate their own skeletons before Home Depot stepped in with a free spare. A crew of local members was en route to set it up when I last spoke with Corcoran.

For her and countless others, the skeleton has also translated to meaningful real-life connections. Corcoran recalled a day she heard a group member in search of Home Depot's new 8-foot pumpkin stack (opens in a new tab) was 40 minutes away from her local store, so she booked it over and held it on her car for him until he arrived.

"It ended up being like eight of us that all ended up showing up down there," she said. "You get to meet people in your community you didn't even know about." Maybe the real Home Depot skeleton is the friends we make along the way.

Perhaps close-knit, well-connected communities like these are why Maddi had so much trouble reselling a skeleton. An East Coast resident who spends a lot of time on social media for work, she purchased one at her local Home Depot this summer after seeing a promo for the retailer's July restock on Twitter, hoping its virality would double her money in a fast sale. (Mashable is not including her last name to protect her identity.)

Alas, no dice: Maddi's listings on Mercari, Craigslist, and Facebook Marketplace have been met with haggling and hostility from strangers, so the skeleton has been sitting unopened in her parents' shed ever since.

"People are surprisingly rude," she said. "They're offering me less than I originally paid for it. Or they just say, 'Ha ha ha, you're never gonna sell this thing.' Or like, 'I can go to Home Depot, buy one for $300, and bring it home. I don't need yours.' And I'm like, well, it's sold out at Home Depot, so I don't know what you expect to do with that."

Love thy neighbor, hate their skeleton

The journey of Home Depot skeleton ownership is not necessarily one for the faint of heart, despite its broad appeal. Enough complaints from HOAs or neighbors can be grounds for disassembly, which is every Home Depot skeleton owners' worst nightmare after vandalism or theft. (I personally would not love seeing a 12-foot skeleton outside my window every day, for what it's worth.) But sometimes a little backlash can work in an owner's favor.

If I get that reaction and I get that smile, then I did my day.

Bridgett Nicolace, of Columbia, South Carolina, told Mashable she often gets people knocking on her door asking to take pictures with her skeleton Billy Bob Bones. "Triple B" stays on her front lawn year-round and has a rotating closet of costumes for different seasons and holidays; Nicolace paid "five or six hundred dollars" to have him shipped from Pennsylvania last fall and makes all of his outfits herself. (She can name his T-shirt size on Amazon — 3XL — off the top of her head.)

Nicolace was surprised when she opened her mailbox one day in March to find an anonymous note demanding that her "trashy" skeleton be taken down, threatening court action "or whatever needs to be done to have it removed" — something she found funny as a former trial attorney. She decided to post a video about it on TikTok, where it's been viewed over 1.9 million times. One of several follow-up videos featured Triple B posing with a meta sign that read, "My mom is a lawyer."

"When I did that video on TikTok and it blew up unexpectedly, a lot of people offered to buy additional items for Triple B," Nicolace said. She decided against making a public Amazon Wish List , citing a discomfort with asking strangers for "handouts," but would love to someday get another Home Depot skeleton — maybe when Triple B's wardrobe gets too full.

Richard Miley, of Watkinsville, Georgia, who purchased his first Home Depot skeleton in April, bedecked "Bone Marley" in a festive oversized Hawaiian shirt and lights for a house party this past summer. As night fell that evening, he heard a banging coming from the house next door: His neighbor had nailed a 10- to 11-foot cross to a shed facing the skeleton. That kicked off "a little war," he said.

Miley has since amassed an army of three classic Home Depot skeletons, one Inferno Pumpkin skeleton, a 12-foot mummy from Lowe's, a 7.6-foot Baphomet animatronic from Spirit Halloween, two giant skulls, and seven five-foot skeletons, which he expands regularly and plans on displaying year-round. He recently installed a 30-foot flagpole, which a 12-foot skeleton named Pamela Skel-Lee "dances" around as her standard-sized counterparts gawk from folding chairs, jaws agape. He's hoping to buy at least three or four more classic 12-foot skeletons, which will get placed around his backyard pool and wrapped with string lights.

"I got at least two grand into it right now. I'm not done yet," said Miley, citing lack of HOA oversight and a best friend who's an attorney. "I think it's well worth it."

For Miley, this is more than just a petty opportunity to stick it to a hater. (To his credit, their back-and-forth has helped his family's 2022 St. Jude fundraiser eclipse its $4,500 goal.) It's also more than just great advertising for Miley's restaurant; everyone in town knows him as the guy with the cool yard that pissed off his neighbors. It's both a personal creative release and a perpetual source of delight for his friends and family — specifically his wife Ashley, a nurse practitioner who works in a COVID intensive care unit.

"If I get that reaction and I get that smile, then I did my day," Miley said.

Until death do us part?

Three years of selling out and amassing a passionate fanbase have posed an important question: Will the Home Depot skeleton bubble ever burst?

The issue was recently raised within 12 Ft Skeleton Halloween Club, prompting discourse among members over whether the prop is still cool or too commonplace. Co-admin Motes brushed off concerns, likening the skeleton to a Christmas tree: "It's how you decorate it, how you display it," he told Mashable, adding that he still spots very few skeletons "out in the wild" in his own neighborhood. Seeing people around the country post pictures of it in a Facebook group dedicated to that specific purpose creates a false sense of oversaturation, he explained. "I feel they should just keep coming every year."

Indeed, all of the Home Depot skeleton owners we spoke with are continuing to find new ways to one-up themselves. Miley said he sources decorating ideas from 12 Ft Skeleton Halloween Club on a regular basis, spending a couple hundred dollars each time "just to make it happen because I want the picture." Nicolace is thinking about dressing Triple B in a capotain and doublet for Thanksgiving. Wilcox will buy a black Santa hat for her skeleton to wear at Christmas. And for her part, letter recipient Jessi Zahm is helping John Skellerman build a rapport with his 3-year-old secret admirer through gift exchanges and weekly personalized notes. A giant replica of her favorite Dairy Queen treat — a Stars & Stripes Starkiss Bar — is currently affixed to his left hand.

For Erin Bain, of Indianapolis, Indiana, the Home Depot skeleton's presence will remain long after hers gets disassembled for the season: She got a tattoo of it on her calf this fall. "I might have the first one — it may not be the last," she said. Coincidentally, Bain's artist Garrett Hudson , of Fountain Square Tattoo, also happens to own a Home Depot skeleton.

Even if the hype (or ink) fades, it's easy to see the Home Depot skeleton living on as a seasonal meme, morphing into a harbinger of spooky season — like Caitlin "Christian Girl Autumn" Covington, minus the great hair. Extremely online filmmaker DiMieri said he's seen enough tweets about the skeleton's merits as a love interest in 2022 that he's set on making a sequel to "My New Boyfriend" with a proposal and wedding scenes, pending enough funding. (Your move, Home Depot.)

It's hard not to root for the skeleton's continued success or existence in the zeitgeist, even as someone who isn't particularly enamored with the osteologic. It's hard to be repulsed by something born out of private desires to create moments of levity. It's hard to fault anyone for squeezing so much communal joy out of a $300 Halloween decoration from a hardware corporation in a post-lockdown world that can be so antagonistic and isolating. There are far worse causes to rally around.

I still won't go within six feet of the Home Depot skeleton if I can help it, to be crystal clear. But the next time we cross paths, I might not be as terrified, knowing I'm in on what feels like a glorious inside joke.
"This is a little strange, I am sure," began the letter Jessi Zahm, of Newberg, Oregon, found on her doorstep this September, "but we live up the street from you and we drive by your house daily."

Zahm had a secret admirer — or rather, one of her Halloween decorations did.

"My daughter who is 3 started a new daycare which has been a struggle," the letter continued. "We have a new routine after I pick her up, we grab dairy queen and then she asks to go see the big skeleton to tell it about her day... Seeing how happy it makes my daughter who was in tears hours earlier [...] makes driving around the block 6 times to move for all the cars worth it."

The skeleton the note referred to, of course, is the $299 "12 ft Giant-Sized Skeleton with LifeEyes™️ LCD Eyes,"(opens in a new tab) a bestselling and highly sought-after decoration from Home Depot's seasonal department.

The prop holds a special place in Zahm's own heart. She goes all-out for Halloween and got her first of two skeletons in September after pining over it for years — a conquest that involved waking up early before work and waiting outside her local Home Depot the day it set out Halloween decorations for the season, she told Mashable in an email. (She now refers to it as "John Skellerman.") But the letter came as a surprise.

"We got misty-eyed," Zahm said. "We never thought someone would love him as much as we do."

Zahm's experience encapsulates a collective and persistent infatuation with the Home Depot skeleton, which originally debuted to rabid fanfare in the fall of 2020. It was the gaunt face that launched a thousand memes and a driving force behind the retailer's " most successful Halloween " to date that year, Home Depot's Chief Operating Officer Ted Decker said in an interview with CNBC , despite a significant dip in holiday spending and participation at the time.

The skeleton might have easily been a pandemic fluke — nothing more than a silly distraction or a temporary salve to societal upheaval. As anyone who bought a Peloton at the peak of its popularity can tell you, people's minds were operating on a different plane in 2020.

Yet even years later, as Zahm could attest, securing a Home Depot skeleton when it gets a rare "Limit 1 per order" drop in 2022 requires luck, timing, and maybe knowing a guy who knows a guy. This year's June and July online restocks both saw the skeleton sell out rapidly, with the former contributing to the highest quarterly earnings in Home Depot history. And aside from a few random reappearances , it's been MIA ever since — scroll through the comments section on its product page for a taste of many wannabe buyers' woes.

Scammers and resellers have gotten in on the action, too, targeting the skeleton as if it were a next-generation gaming console or a limited-edition sneaker. Listings on resale platforms like Facebook Marketplace and eBay ask hundreds of dollars over retail price.

I set like 10 alarms because I was like, 'What if he sells out?'

Consumer response to the skeleton has been so immense that Home Depot decided to add more giant Halloween decorations to its lineup, according to Senior Merchant of Decorative Holiday Lance Allen, who affectionately calls the prop "Skelly." (For the record, Allen said the skeleton uses whatever pronouns buyers deem fit. A gender-fluid icon .) First was the 2021 release of a 12-foot Inferno Pumpkin Skeleton (opens in a new tab), a "spicy," corpsey cousin for the classic model priced at $379. This year's additions included a 15-foot Towering Phantom (opens in a new tab), a 12-foot Hovering Witch (opens in a new tab), and a 9.5-foot Immortal Werewolf (opens in a new tab), which went for $299 to $399 apiece.

Like any good viral sensation , the original Home Depot skeleton also spawned copycats at other stores. Lowe's , Walmart (opens in a new tab), Best Buy (opens in a new tab), Costco , and JOANN Fabrics have all sought to ride the Big Skeleton wave in 2022. A suspiciously decent knockoff on Amazon (opens in a new tab) was sold out at the time of publication, having been listed between $325.95 to $1,999.99. (To quote one customer's five-star review: "He is big!!!!")

In a way, the Home Depot skeleton was destined to be a hit. Its 60 pounds of beige high-density polyethylene stand at an imposing 12 feet — technically 11.7, if you go by the specifications on its online listing. Its two blue-green animated LifeEyes call to mind a certain Miley Cyrus meme while slow-blinking into space, as if it were trying to bond with onlookers. It's weatherproof. It's semi-posable. It takes two human adults approximately one hour to assemble. It could hypothetically go through airport security. It's massive. Its potency as a meme is undeniable.

"I think 'too absurd to fail' is a great way to put it," said Anthony DiMieri, a New York City-based writer, director, and producer. Self-described as "way too online," he turned horny tweets about the Home Depot skeleton into "My New Boyfriend," a 2021 short film satirizing the modern dating scene that stars our tall king as a love interest. (It would have come out sooner, but all the Home Depot skeletons DiMieri could find on eBay in 2020 were marked up four times retail price.) The mere phrase "12-foot skeleton from Home Depot" is comedy gold in its specificity and strangeness, he explained.

Scarcity as a self-fulfilling prophecy has also contributed to the skeleton's runaway success, compounded by the fact that its price hasn't increased in its three years on the market — even after Home Depot started including a plug-in power adapter in 2021. Concerns that the skeleton would get more expensive this year because of record-high inflation motivated Lindsey Wilcox, of Warner Robins, Georgia, to finally coordinate a purchase with her boyfriend and best friend; they wound up financing it with a Klarna payment plan .

"I was really nervous about it," Wilcox told Mashable. "I set like 10 alarms because I was like, 'What if he sells out?'" The upper half of her skeleton has a permanent home as part of the TV stand, now the focal point of her apartment.

But something about the skeleton's staying power continues to confound. The number of viral products that have faded into obscurity as soon as the next big thing trends is incalculable — something new should have usurped its throne by now. (The jacked werewolf tried its best ; Home Depot had it on clearance at the time of publication.) Yet the skeleton has returned with gusto in the summers and falls since its inception, like a marigold bloom, indoctrinating new generations of skele-sciples. It's almost as if this supersized symbol of death has taken on a life of its own.

Fear factor

Most of my reporting on this story was driven by a journalistic need for answers to the whys and hows of this viral trend, but I'd be remiss if I didn't disclose a deeply personal quest to confront a lifelong phobia.

Growing up, I remember ordering my three younger sisters to say "SK" in place of "skeleton" because the word alone scared me. The Hunchback of Notre Dame, The Nightmare Before Christmas, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, and FernGully: The Last Rainforest were all banned from family movie nights because of skeleton cameos. I can't touch anything that has a skeleton on it, whether it's a T-shirt or the cover of an anatomy book. I have spent the past three decades trying to ignore the fact that there is one under my own skin right now — you don't need to remind me. (Please do not remind me.)

In mid-September 2022, after I'd had several lovely conversations with 12-foot skeleton owners from around the country, a tweet alerted me to the fact that my local Home Depot in Chicago's Lincoln Park neighborhood had one on display. I felt a moral obligation to see this thing after everything I'd heard and read. (My colleagues at Mashable have covered restocks , dupes , and the Inferno Pumpkin launch .) At the very least, I could use the trip as an excuse to grab a hot dog after work.

After I stepped off the parking garage's industrial elevator and rounded a pallet of blue windshield washer fluid, there it was — in the center of the floor, smack dab between the escalators leading to and from the appliance and paint departments, with a homemade sign attached to its wrist that said, "PLEASE DO NOT TOUCH SKELETON."

I wish I could call our encounter a personal reckoning, a watershed moment of clarity, or a healing round of exposure therapy. Faint feelings of familiarity and "wow, so this is the guy!" were percolating somewhere. But mostly I was just freaked out. I did not feel well in its presence, much less a desire to make physical contact. It was simply too big, too spooky, too skeleton-y.

Getting close enough for a decent photo I could send to the family group chat was physically distressing — "is that the 12 foot sk," one sister texted back — but it did draw my eye to the small price tag next to the sign. In the interest of due diligence, I approached a nearby apron-clad associate to ask whether it was in stock.

"No," he answered sheepishly.

How long had it been sold out?

"About three weeks now."

A star is born

Every legend needs an origin story, and one side of the skeleton's goes largely untold. Despite being widely known as the Home Depot skeleton, it was actually developed in tandem with a tiny seasonal product design and consultancy business called Seasonal Visions International, which operates out of Berkeley and San Diego, Calif. A sister company called SVI Global Ltd. manufactures its products in China and sells them to retailers around the world.

Not that anyone would glean that from a Google search. SVI doesn't maintain any socials aside from a dormant Facebook page , and the closest it has to a website is a wiki within the Spirit Halloween Fandom community. The only traces of it on the Home Depot website are found within the Questions & Answers section of its products' listings, where "SVI Product Expert" responds to customer concerns.

This secrecy is intentional, according to a person deeply familiar with SVI who spoke to Mashable under the condition of anonymity: The company doesn't want to steal the spotlight from its retail partners. Other SVI-made decorations include Home Depot's new phantom, floating witch, and werewolf, as well as Best Buy's 8-foot Towering Skeleton with "Digieyes" (the non-trademarked version of LifeEyes). For its part, Home Depot told Mashable that SVI "has been a fantastic partner — they're true innovators in holiday products and décor."

As the store's Senior Merchant of Decorative Holiday, Allen is often touted as the skeleton's creator, having been inspired by a giant torso that appeared at trade shows and haunted houses in 2019. The prop was the result of trying to "bring customers innovation and quality that has never been available in a retail setting" while "[pushing] the limits with our engineer and manufacturing capabilities," Allen told Mashable in a statement.

Jazzing up an otherwise static decoration with moving, dilating LCD eyes was one way to accomplish that. But why 12 feet, specifically?

"The height of a [10-foot] basketball hoop seemed impressive, but we knew our team could do better," said Allen. "We decided on 12 feet because the image of two grown men standing on top of each other's heads seemed like it would be a showstopper!"

As cool as the skeleton seemed, the onset of the COVID pandemic in early 2020 had SVI worried about a Halloween season for the first time in its 19-year history, our source said. Would anyone be in the mood to celebrate? You don't have to be an economist to recognize the fact that extravagant decorations of the morbid and macabre were a hard sell at the time, especially in an economy upended by supply chain crises and a sharp decline in consumer spending. No one was hoarding an emergency fund for a $300 giant skeleton.

But people were, in fact, in the mood. SVI had never experienced such an enormous public response to one of its products before, which our source partially credited to word of mouth and a mention in the popular true crime podcast My Favorite Murder. Some people within the company kept scrapbooks.

Home Depot itself had a hunch the skeleton would be popular with its customers after it took off online that summer, said Allen, but no one there fully understood the magnitude of its stardom until it went on display in stores in August, when it "exploded overnight." Allen didn't explicitly confirm whether the skeleton was originally intended to be a one-time deal for 2020, but did note that Home Depot "wanted to ensure we continued to bring that excitement to our customers" after many missed out on its introduction. (The SVI source said its scarcity in 2020 and 2021 was the direct result of supply chain snags, which simmered down in time for the first 2022 restock.)

The skeleton opened many doors for SVI, which swiftly became a name among the Halloween decorating community. But none of its other products have had a bony grip on consumers quite like the original 12-footer.

Skelly die-hards

If there's an official fan club for the Home Depot skeleton, it lives on Facebook. Groups dedicated to the decoration have ballooned and multiplied over the past two years, in many cases amassing tens of thousands of members each. Conservative estimates for across-the-board totals would be well over the 100,000 mark.

These Facebook groups have become epicenters for all factions of the fandom, from hardcore Halloween people who decorate year-round to casuals who are just trying to have the spookiest yard on their block. They're gathering spaces where someone can revel in the triumph of finally buying a skeleton after a months- or yearslong hunt. They're virtual highlight reels for showing off displays, runways for outfit inspiration, and creative outlets for sharing modifications. (Metallic spray paints, skull-to-phalange glitter, and rustic wood stains were huge for SS22.) They're sounding boards for punny name ideas. They're fountains of wisdom on how to secure it properly, prevent it from getting stolen, or persuade a spouse to buy another. They're sources of empathy when hardships and natural disasters force a premature disassembly. They're war rooms for swapping tips on how to win over neighbors and homeowners associations.

The Home Depot skeleton has found itself in an infinite number of locations, outfits, and poses as a result of these Facebook groups, morphing into some sort of cross between Flat Stanley and a Midwestern porch goose . One does not simply own this thing; it joins your family. It gives you a story to tell at parties. To know the Home Depot skeleton is to love it — or at least feel a compulsion to talk about it.

"We are aware of the many fun groups and communities online and are so excited that The Home Depot fans have come together to celebrate our original giant, Skelly," said Allen. "We hope their enthusiasm will continue to extend to Skelly's friends and fellow giants."

Jennifer Penelope Corcoran, of Nashville, Tenn., is the mastermind behind 12 Ft Skeleton Halloween Club , a hub for "owners, soon-to-be owners, and admirers of the 12-foot skeleton to share pics, tips, and ideas." (Yes, they've made T-shirts.) She created the group on Sept. 5, 2020, having just bought a skeleton during a restock and seen people post about it in other holiday decorating forums. But she wasn't sure whether it would gain any traction.

Cut to the group's current membership count of over 50,000 people, the largest in the genre, which grows daily.

"It's completely happened by accident," said Corcoran, whose display now includes two Home Depot skeletons nicknamed Ray and Frankie Blue Eyes, an Inferno Pumpkin variant, the 12-foot witch, the 15-foot phantom, the 9.5-foot werewolf, a giant snake, various skeletal animals, some Haunted Mansion-inspired cutouts, and a 20-foot inflatable cat from Amazon she calls Princess Meow Meow. (As far as a theme goes, "it's really more lack of willpower than anything else," Corcoran joked.)

Corcoran told Mashable she found Home Depot's Allen on Facebook to invite him to the group shortly after its inception, only to discover he was already a member. A 2021 media preview was the start of her team's close working relationship with the retailer, which keeps close tabs on the community and flags upcoming restocks — intel it relays to members as "Code Orange" alerts as soon as drops go live.

"We'll email them about stuff all the time and they get back to us right away," said Corcoran of Home Depot, which invited her and Randy Motes, a co-admin from the Dallas-Fort Worth area, back for its in-person Halloween and holiday showcase in 2022. "They enjoy it, they enjoy seeing everybody's displays and the things people are doing with it…They're definitely fun to work with."

SVI is also embedded within 12 Ft Skeleton Halloween Club, though it tries to maintain a low profile. Corcoran described their relationship as a symbiotic one: Her team can put group members in touch with SVI for troubleshooting and replacement parts; in turn, SVI gets to see how customers are interacting with their products. Sometimes they'll send YouTube videos with setup tips and tricks, she added. "They want customers to be happy, too."

Serving as middlemen between these companies and consumers is just one facet of running 12 Ft Skeleton Halloween Club for Corcoran and her dedicated squad of 19 other admins and moderators; the rest involves a thoughtful balance of customer service, informal PR, and community-building. Post approval stays on to kill leaks, deter spam, and make sure members resell extras at cost. Threads are watched closely to ensure conversations stay civil and on-topic. Co-admin Motes tries to personally refresh the group's cover photo on a daily basis to showcase as many group members' skeletons as possible — though "I know I miss hundreds," he told Mashable. Each member of the team spends an average of 10 to 40 hours a week tending to the group, said Corcoran.

All this over a seasonal prop from a home improvement store? It's easy to see the appeal of Facebook groups dedicated to shared, hyper-specific interests at a time when online connections were lifelines. But most members of 12 Ft Skeleton Halloween Club would probably tell you it's evolved into something more.

The group parlayed its sense of community into a nationwide fundraising campaign during the 2021 Halloween season, raising over $150,000 for St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. Members rallied behind a family in Austin, Texas, whose Home Depot skeleton was stolen in broad daylight , offering to chip in for a replacement and even donate their own skeletons before Home Depot stepped in with a free spare. A crew of local members was en route to set it up when I last spoke with Corcoran.

For her and countless others, the skeleton has also translated to meaningful real-life connections. Corcoran recalled a day she heard a group member in search of Home Depot's new 8-foot pumpkin stack (opens in a new tab) was 40 minutes away from her local store, so she booked it over and held it on her car for him until he arrived.

"It ended up being like eight of us that all ended up showing up down there," she said. "You get to meet people in your community you didn't even know about." Maybe the real Home Depot skeleton is the friends we make along the way.

Perhaps close-knit, well-connected communities like these are why Maddi had so much trouble reselling a skeleton. An East Coast resident who spends a lot of time on social media for work, she purchased one at her local Home Depot this summer after seeing a promo for the retailer's July restock on Twitter, hoping its virality would double her money in a fast sale. (Mashable is not including her last name to protect her identity.)

Alas, no dice: Maddi's listings on Mercari, Craigslist, and Facebook Marketplace have been met with haggling and hostility from strangers, so the skeleton has been sitting unopened in her parents' shed ever since.

"People are surprisingly rude," she said. "They're offering me less than I originally paid for it. Or they just say, 'Ha ha ha, you're never gonna sell this thing.' Or like, 'I can go to Home Depot, buy one for $300, and bring it home. I don't need yours.' And I'm like, well, it's sold out at Home Depot, so I don't know what you expect to do with that."

Love thy neighbor, hate their skeleton

The journey of Home Depot skeleton ownership is not necessarily one for the faint of heart, despite its broad appeal. Enough complaints from HOAs or neighbors can be grounds for disassembly, which is every Home Depot skeleton owners' worst nightmare after vandalism or theft. (I personally would not love seeing a 12-foot skeleton outside my window every day, for what it's worth.) But sometimes a little backlash can work in an owner's favor.

If I get that reaction and I get that smile, then I did my day.

Bridgett Nicolace, of Columbia, South Carolina, told Mashable she often gets people knocking on her door asking to take pictures with her skeleton Billy Bob Bones. "Triple B" stays on her front lawn year-round and has a rotating closet of costumes for different seasons and holidays; Nicolace paid "five or six hundred dollars" to have him shipped from Pennsylvania last fall and makes all of his outfits herself. (She can name his T-shirt size on Amazon — 3XL — off the top of her head.)

Nicolace was surprised when she opened her mailbox one day in March to find an anonymous note demanding that her "trashy" skeleton be taken down, threatening court action "or whatever needs to be done to have it removed" — something she found funny as a former trial attorney. She decided to post a video about it on TikTok, where it's been viewed over 1.9 million times. One of several follow-up videos featured Triple B posing with a meta sign that read, "My mom is a lawyer."

"When I did that video on TikTok and it blew up unexpectedly, a lot of people offered to buy additional items for Triple B," Nicolace said. She decided against making a public Amazon Wish List , citing a discomfort with asking strangers for "handouts," but would love to someday get another Home Depot skeleton — maybe when Triple B's wardrobe gets too full.

Richard Miley, of Watkinsville, Georgia, who purchased his first Home Depot skeleton in April, bedecked "Bone Marley" in a festive oversized Hawaiian shirt and lights for a house party this past summer. As night fell that evening, he heard a banging coming from the house next door: His neighbor had nailed a 10- to 11-foot cross to a shed facing the skeleton. That kicked off "a little war," he said.

Miley has since amassed an army of three classic Home Depot skeletons, one Inferno Pumpkin skeleton, a 12-foot mummy from Lowe's, a 7.6-foot Baphomet animatronic from Spirit Halloween, two giant skulls, and seven five-foot skeletons, which he expands regularly and plans on displaying year-round. He recently installed a 30-foot flagpole, which a 12-foot skeleton named Pamela Skel-Lee "dances" around as her standard-sized counterparts gawk from folding chairs, jaws agape. He's hoping to buy at least three or four more classic 12-foot skeletons, which will get placed around his backyard pool and wrapped with string lights.

"I got at least two grand into it right now. I'm not done yet," said Miley, citing lack of HOA oversight and a best friend who's an attorney. "I think it's well worth it."

For Miley, this is more than just a petty opportunity to stick it to a hater. (To his credit, their back-and-forth has helped his family's 2022 St. Jude fundraiser eclipse its $4,500 goal.) It's also more than just great advertising for Miley's restaurant; everyone in town knows him as the guy with the cool yard that pissed off his neighbors. It's both a personal creative release and a perpetual source of delight for his friends and family — specifically his wife Ashley, a nurse practitioner who works in a COVID intensive care unit.

"If I get that reaction and I get that smile, then I did my day," Miley said.

Until death do us part?

Three years of selling out and amassing a passionate fanbase have posed an important question: Will the Home Depot skeleton bubble ever burst?

The issue was recently raised within 12 Ft Skeleton Halloween Club, prompting discourse among members over whether the prop is still cool or too commonplace. Co-admin Motes brushed off concerns, likening the skeleton to a Christmas tree: "It's how you decorate it, how you display it," he told Mashable, adding that he still spots very few skeletons "out in the wild" in his own neighborhood. Seeing people around the country post pictures of it in a Facebook group dedicated to that specific purpose creates a false sense of oversaturation, he explained. "I feel they should just keep coming every year."

Indeed, all of the Home Depot skeleton owners we spoke with are continuing to find new ways to one-up themselves. Miley said he sources decorating ideas from 12 Ft Skeleton Halloween Club on a regular basis, spending a couple hundred dollars each time "just to make it happen because I want the picture." Nicolace is thinking about dressing Triple B in a capotain and doublet for Thanksgiving. Wilcox will buy a black Santa hat for her skeleton to wear at Christmas. And for her part, letter recipient Jessi Zahm is helping John Skellerman build a rapport with his 3-year-old secret admirer through gift exchanges and weekly personalized notes. A giant replica of her favorite Dairy Queen treat — a Stars & Stripes Starkiss Bar — is currently affixed to his left hand.

For Erin Bain, of Indianapolis, Indiana, the Home Depot skeleton's presence will remain long after hers gets disassembled for the season: She got a tattoo of it on her calf this fall. "I might have the first one — it may not be the last," she said. Coincidentally, Bain's artist Garrett Hudson , of Fountain Square Tattoo, also happens to own a Home Depot skeleton.

Even if the hype (or ink) fades, it's easy to see the Home Depot skeleton living on as a seasonal meme, morphing into a harbinger of spooky season — like Caitlin "Christian Girl Autumn" Covington, minus the great hair. Extremely online filmmaker DiMieri said he's seen enough tweets about the skeleton's merits as a love interest in 2022 that he's set on making a sequel to "My New Boyfriend" with a proposal and wedding scenes, pending enough funding. (Your move, Home Depot.)

It's hard not to root for the skeleton's continued success or existence in the zeitgeist, even as someone who isn't particularly enamored with the osteologic. It's hard to be repulsed by something born out of private desires to create moments of levity. It's hard to fault anyone for squeezing so much communal joy out of a $300 Halloween decoration from a hardware corporation in a post-lockdown world that can be so antagonistic and isolating. There are far worse causes to rally around.

I still won't go within six feet of the Home Depot skeleton if I can help it, to be crystal clear. But the next time we cross paths, I might not be as terrified, knowing I'm in on what feels like a glorious inside joke.
Have you seen the boy in the purple shirt all over your timeline or FYP? Does his face ring a bell, but you just can't place him and the generic fictional school background in which he exists? We've got you covered.

The internet's current favorite reaction meme is none other than Jake Short, who starred as Fletcher Quimby in Disney Channel's A.N.T. Farm. In the meme-ified series of images, Short's facial expressions encapsulate the feeling of being caught red-handed, making it the perfect meme to share a hot take or admit something embarrassing — two of the chronically online's favorite hobbies.

The stills of Short are screenshots from two on-set interviews he gave with Fanlala and Popstar! back in 2011. For a quick refresher, A.N.T. Farm told the story of a crew of talented pre-teens who attend the Advanced Natural Talent (A.N.T.) program at their local high school. It centered around music prodigy Chyna Parks played by China Anne McClain. Short's character was an artistic genius whose brilliance began and ended with art. The television show aired from 2011 to 2014.

According to Know Your Meme, the images of Short took off on Twitter during the first week of October and have since migrated over to TikTok. Previously, reaction memes like this one would have been confined to Twitter and Instagram, but because of TikTok's new photo mode that allows users to post up to 35 photos in a slideshow, it's all over the video-first platform as well.

On TikTok, the meme is being used to express the stages of grief one goes through before admitting something embarrassing. For example, @towerofsoup posted a video that reads, "what types of books do you read" in reference to reading smut. Another, posted by @jessica.h427, reads, "did you just hit a curb??" The meme is often accompanied by "My Humps" from the Black Eyed Peas, which has soundtracked over 60,000 TikToks to date. The "Fletcher meme" tag has been viewed nearly 30 million times.

When every popular social media platform is trying to be everything, memes take on different meanings depending on where you encounter them. Meme language is ever-evolving, and sometimes all you need is one seemingly random bit of Gen Z nostalgia to unite the internet.

Horror movies come in all shapes and sizes.

You've got your comedy horrors, your psychological horrors, your tense thriller-y horrors — and, of course, your genuinely scary horrors.

I'm not just talking about your run-of-the-mill, yikes-that's-a-bit-creepy kind of films, here, either. I'm talking about the truly terror-inducing — the type of movies you wake in the dead of night thinking about, and which stay with you for a long, long time after the credits have rolled. The horribly twitchy, sleep-with-the-lights-on-and-avoid-all-mirrors kind of movies.

Streaming platform Shudder has a lot to offer in this regard.

We've combed through the archives of the service (which is chock-full of horror, sci-fi and thrillers of all kinds) to track down the most terrifying films we could — from jumpy classics like The Descent to Demian Rugna's aptly named Terrified. If you're unable to deal with jump-scares, these are not for you.

Cushions to hide behind at the ready...

What's it about?

After the strange death of their mother, a family begins to suspect that her presence may not have entirely left the house.

Why's it so scary?

Indonesian director Joko Anwar knows how to make a creepy film. It's apparent during the opening scenes in Satan's Slaves, when Rini (Tara Basro) makes a grim discovery in her mother's bedroom, and it only gets clearer from there on out. The movie has a solid mixture of slow build, bumps-in-the-night style tension, and outright jump-scares, putting you on edge early and offering little by way of reprieve.

For fans of Ring (which features further down on this list), there's even a very creepy well...

What's it about?

After one of her twins dies during childbirth, a new mother grows increasingly fearful that something is coming after her surviving baby.

Why's it so scary?

Fair warning: If you're expecting a child, have recently had a child, or are considering having a child at any point in the near future, this may be one to avoid. Brandon Christensen's film very effectively plays on fears of motherhood and mental health, bringing together pretty much every worst nightmare scenario imaginable for a new parent.

Like Christensen's other film on this list (see Z, further down), Still/Born thrives on its jump-scares — and there are plenty of those to be had, often delivered via the medium of fuzzy-screened baby monitors and late-night security camera footage.

What's it about?

A journalist attempts to get to the bottom of a cursed video tape, which supposedly kills the viewer a week after they've watched it.

Why's it so scary?

Hideo Nakata's 1998 horror classic not only kick-started a global franchise, but it also proved you don't necessarily need high-tech special effects and intense music to generate scares. By today's standards, Ring may not provide as many jump-scares as some as the other films on this list, but there are still plenty of nightmare-inducing scenes and images (and you probably won't ever look at a well, or a grainy TV set, in quite the same way again).

What's it about?

A brother and sister return to their parents' farmhouse to help their mother care for their dying father. But after things take a sudden, tragic turn, they realise something more sinister is going on.

Why’s it so scary?

Creaky old remote farmhouses are already the ideal setting for jumps, but Bryan Bertino's chiller is extra effective because of its use of sound — whether it's jangling horseshoes placed to ward off evil, a jagged background score or simply yawning, empty silence. The jumps in this one are unexpected and genuinely terrifying, and the story is unremittingly bleak.

What's it about?

Unable to meet in person due to the coronavirus lockdown, a group of friends decide to try out a seance over Zoom.

Why's it so scary?

One word: realism. The premise of the story, its Zoom setting, and the very natural dialogue all conspire to make Host feel horribly realistic. It's like you're watching the recording of an actual Zoom call between friends, and that makes it all the more unnerving when things begin to go really, really wrong.

Oh, and if you're worried that the movie's set-up might be limiting in terms of scares, don't be: the jumps in this one are frequent, and — thanks to the creativity of director Rob Savage — always inventive.

What's it about?

A group of paranormal investigators examines some disturbing goings-on in a neighbourhood in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

Why's it so scary?

Rather than just having one scary monster or theme, Demián Rugna's Terrified has a whole bunch of them — from IT-style voices gurgling away in the drain to the unmoving corpse of a dead child, returned home from the grave to sit stiffly at the dinner table.

Basically, the film is a trick box full of scares, and if one thing doesn't get to you, chances are something else certainly will.

What's it about?

After the opening of a haunted house tourist attraction results in death, a fictional documentary crew tries to uncover what really happened.

Why's it so scary?

Like all the best found-footage horror movies, Stephen Cognetti's Hell House LLC uses realism to amp up its fear factor, splicing shaky camera shots with moving mannequins and half-glimpsed figures in the night. The tourist attraction setting could easily have come across as cheesy in this one, but luckily the movie's prop department sourced some genuinely creepy-looking clowns for the occasion (one of which provides more than a few nasty jumps).

What's it about?

A mother grows increasingly worried about her eight-year-old son after he gets a new imaginary friend called "Z."

Why's it so scary?

If the likes of The Babadook and Hide and Seek have taught us anything, it's that children having imaginary friends (at least in the context of a horror movie) is never a great thing. Brandon Christensen's Z takes this concept and gives it a fresh twist, putting us in the shoes of Beth (Keegan Connor Tracy) as she grows increasingly disturbed by her son's behaviour.

The thing that makes Z so unnerving isn't so much the creepy child aspect as it is the unknowable monster — the lingering idea of "Z," this unseen creature that dominates every scene with its absence. The fear of seeing something is often more disturbing than the thing itself, and this is an idea that the movie understands perfectly well — and uses to nail-biting effect.

What's it about?

A policeman investigates a village rampant with a mysterious disease linked to murderous rages.

Why's it so scary?

Na Hong-jin's 2016 South Korean horror film The Wailing is an offbeat and low-simmering horror that'll unsettle you to your core. Less of a belligerent shock-riding horror and more of an atmospheric long game, the film is still frankly terrifying. As Vox points out, the film does include some xenophobic elements, which the director has dismissed. — Shannon Connellan, UK Editor

What’s it about?

A group of women go spelunking in North Carolina’s Appalachian Mountains. After they become trapped in an unexplored part of the cave system, though, it becomes clear they’re not alone.

Why’s it so scary?

Wriggling through horrendously narrow underground tunnels is already bad enough, but when you throw cave-dwelling zombie creatures into the mix things really ramp up. Neil Marshall’s movie is very jumpy, and one to steer well clear of if you suffer from claustrophobia.

The horribly twitchy, sleep-with-the-lights-on-and-avoid-all-mirrors kind of movies.

Streaming platform Shudder has a lot to offer in this regard.

We've combed through the archives of the service (which is chock-full of horror, sci-fi and thrillers of all kinds) to track down the most terrifying films we could — from jumpy classics like The Descent to Demian Rugna's aptly named Terrified. If you're unable to deal with jump-scares, these are not for you.

Cushions to hide behind at the ready...

What's it about?

After the strange death of their mother, a family begins to suspect that her presence may not have entirely left the house.

Why's it so scary?

Indonesian director Joko Anwar knows how to make a creepy film. It's apparent during the opening scenes in Satan's Slaves, when Rini (Tara Basro) makes a grim discovery in her mother's bedroom, and it only gets clearer from there on out. The movie has a solid mixture of slow build, bumps-in-the-night style tension, and outright jump-scares, putting you on edge early and offering little by way of reprieve.

For fans of Ring (which features further down on this list), there's even a very creepy well...

What's it about?

After one of her twins dies during childbirth, a new mother grows increasingly fearful that something is coming after her surviving baby.

Why's it so scary?

Fair warning: If you're expecting a child, have recently had a child, or are considering having a child at any point in the near future, this may be one to avoid. Brandon Christensen's film very effectively plays on fears of motherhood and mental health, bringing together pretty much every worst nightmare scenario imaginable for a new parent.

Like Christensen's other film on this list (see Z, further down), Still/Born thrives on its jump-scares — and there are plenty of those to be had, often delivered via the medium of fuzzy-screened baby monitors and late-night security camera footage.

What's it about?

A journalist attempts to get to the bottom of a cursed video tape, which supposedly kills the viewer a week after they've watched it.

Why's it so scary?

Hideo Nakata's 1998 horror classic not only kick-started a global franchise, but it also proved you don't necessarily need high-tech special effects and intense music to generate scares. By today's standards, Ring may not provide as many jump-scares as some as the other films on this list, but there are still plenty of nightmare-inducing scenes and images (and you probably won't ever look at a well, or a grainy TV set, in quite the same way again).

What's it about?

A brother and sister return to their parents' farmhouse to help their mother care for their dying father. But after things take a sudden, tragic turn, they realise something more sinister is going on.

Why’s it so scary?

Creaky old remote farmhouses are already the ideal setting for jumps, but Bryan Bertino's chiller is extra effective because of its use of sound — whether it's jangling horseshoes placed to ward off evil, a jagged background score or simply yawning, empty silence. The jumps in this one are unexpected and genuinely terrifying, and the story is unremittingly bleak.

What's it about?

Unable to meet in person due to the coronavirus lockdown, a group of friends decide to try out a seance over Zoom.

Why's it so scary?

One word: realism. The premise of the story, its Zoom setting, and the very natural dialogue all conspire to make Host feel horribly realistic. It's like you're watching the recording of an actual Zoom call between friends, and that makes it all the more unnerving when things begin to go really, really wrong.

Oh, and if you're worried that the movie's set-up might be limiting in terms of scares, don't be: the jumps in this one are frequent, and — thanks to the creativity of director Rob Savage — always inventive.

What's it about?

A group of paranormal investigators examines some disturbing goings-on in a neighbourhood in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

Why's it so scary?

Rather than just having one scary monster or theme, Demián Rugna's Terrified has a whole bunch of them — from IT-style voices gurgling away in the drain to the unmoving corpse of a dead child, returned home from the grave to sit stiffly at the dinner table.

Basically, the film is a trick box full of scares, and if one thing doesn't get to you, chances are something else certainly will.

Featured Video For You 'Nightmare Alley' director Guillermo del Toro explains what makes carnival noir so terrifying

What's it about?

After the opening of a haunted house tourist attraction results in death, a fictional documentary crew tries to uncover what really happened.

Why's it so scary?

Like all the best found-footage horror movies, Stephen Cognetti's Hell House LLC uses realism to amp up its fear factor, splicing shaky camera shots with moving mannequins and half-glimpsed figures in the night. The tourist attraction setting could easily have come across as cheesy in this one, but luckily the movie's prop department sourced some genuinely creepy-looking clowns for the occasion (one of which provides more than a few nasty jumps).

What's it about?

A mother grows increasingly worried about her eight-year-old son after he gets a new imaginary friend called "Z."

Why's it so scary?

If the likes of The Babadook and Hide and Seek have taught us anything, it's that children having imaginary friends (at least in the context of a horror movie) is never a great thing. Brandon Christensen's Z takes this concept and gives it a fresh twist, putting us in the shoes of Beth (Keegan Connor Tracy) as she grows increasingly disturbed by her son's behaviour.

The thing that makes Z so unnerving isn't so much the creepy child aspect as it is the unknowable monster — the lingering idea of "Z," this unseen creature that dominates every scene with its absence. The fear of seeing something is often more disturbing than the thing itself, and this is an idea that the movie understands perfectly well — and uses to nail-biting effect.

What's it about?

A policeman investigates a village rampant with a mysterious disease linked to murderous rages.

Why's it so scary?

Na Hong-jin's 2016 South Korean horror film The Wailing is an offbeat and low-simmering horror that'll unsettle you to your core. Less of a belligerent shock-riding horror and more of an atmospheric long game, the film is still frankly terrifying. As Vox points out, the film does include some xenophobic elements, which the director has dismissed. — Shannon Connellan, UK Editor

What’s it about?

A group of women go spelunking in North Carolina’s Appalachian Mountains. After they become trapped in an unexplored part of the cave system, though, it becomes clear they’re not alone.

Why’s it so scary?

Wriggling through horrendously narrow underground tunnels is already bad enough, but when you throw cave-dwelling zombie creatures into the mix things really ramp up. Neil Marshall’s movie is very jumpy, and one to steer well clear of if you suffer from claustrophobia.

"But I have to," he groaned through the cracks of my iPhone 4. "It’s in the name of self-care." I was sitting on the edge of my bed, staring fixated at the black mould splattering the ceiling of my third-year university house share. I’d just returned from my then-boyfriend’s house, where we were celebrating his return to our university city after spending some time in his hometown. Everything was fine in the time we spent together, but during the half-an-hour bus ride to reach my home, he had suddenly experienced an epiphany where he determined that the right thing to do was to immediately call time on our relationship — but it’s okay, he isn’t the bad guy, because it was all done in the name of "self-care."

Sure, he could’ve communicated his concerns earlier, but under this definition of self-care, you don’t "owe" people anything. Suddenly, every relationship in your life becomes transactional, as you hyperfocus on how the people in your life are serving you, and cutting them off or shutting them down the minute they seem to desire anything in return.

When did self-care become…something else?

Once upon a time, self-care was about striving to be the best version of yourself, because ultimately, how can you look after others if you aren’t looking after yourself?

The history of self-care goes way back — all the way back to Socrates. Self-care also has roots in Black history. As Black feminist writer and civil rights activist Audre Lorde wrote in her 1988 essay collection A Burst of Light: "Caring for myself is not self-indulgence. It is self-preservation, and that is an act of political warfare." Lorde defines self-care as a radical act of resistance and a means of survival. Self-care is also all about compassion and community, and as Mashable journalist Chris Taylor puts it , "Self-care isn't performative self-coddling. It's doing the hard work of examining and improving yourself in order to better serve the world."

The problem is, wellness and internet culture have essentially stolen the term, which has led to the original definition of self-care to become co-opted. Thanks to Twitter discourse, the creator economy, and wellness culture colliding, this nonsensical version of "self-care" has grown a life of its own, and from there has amassed a self-indulgent cult of devoted followers.

Google Trends data shows that in the last five years, searches for "self-care" have almost tripled, while over 66 million Instagram posts include the #selfcare hashtag. Meanwhile, the #SelfCare tag on TikTok has racked up a cumulative 30 billion views, as the app encourages users to "show us how you prioritise yourself." Prioritising yourself is important, but should this come at the expense of others?

The version of self-care that I'd learned about from social media felt like a golden ticket to do all the destructive things I wanted to do.

Like a lot of scams, this co-opted version of self-care preys on vulnerable people. In my case, I was experiencing a particularly bad patch with my OCD and was angry at the world. The version of self-care that I'd learned about from social media felt like a golden ticket to do all the destructive things I wanted to do — neglecting staying in touch with my family, blocking people whenever they mildly irritating me, and trauma-dumping on my friends for hours on end but then refusing to let them lean on me for support because their burdens were detrimental to my mental health.

Integrative psychotherapist Caroline Plumer, who runs her own therapy and coaching practice CPCC London, told Mashable that "self care is a crucial part of preserving our mental health and building resilience. But like most things in life, the term can be misused, or taken as an excuse to refuse to compromise even where perhaps we should."

Online spaces have co-opted the meaning of 'self care'

The language of self-care — which aims to give words to coping strategies, boundary setting techniques and non-violent communication styles — has entered mainstream internet discourse. The only problem is: these words are often used incorrectly. Phrases like "toxic," "love-bombing," "narcissist," and "trauma-dumping" are thrown around far too liberally and applied inaccurately. In online spaces, where our hot takes are largely limited to 280 characters, these deeply important and complex psychological terms and definitions are stripped of all their nuance and turned into trendy buzzwords. A friend disagreeing with you about where to meet becomes "toxic." A roommate who asks you to wash your dishes becomes a "narcissist." A person on a dating app opening with a cheesy pick-up line becomes a "love-bomber."

All of these terms exist for a reason — they help people understand and recognise when they’re being mistreated — to put a name to often-traumatic experiences and feelings they’ve had — but in our pursuit to look holier-than-thou 24/7 online, these terms have become an extremely diluted version of their original meaning.

As Plumer explains: "Whilst self care done right can often lead to us having more patience and emotional generosity towards others, there are some that see self care as the practice of consistently prioritising their own wants and needs above everyone else's, including the greater good." She adds: "While getting our needs met is important, we do need to do this with respect for others and a willingness to meet in the middle where appropriate."

When self-care is just a euphemism for selfish

In the aftermath of George Floyd’s murder, white activists spoke about how they were suffering with " allyship fatigue " — lamenting about how posting a black square and attending a march or two had wreaked havoc on their mental health, and how for the sake of their wellbeing, they could no longer show their solidarity with Black people.

Earlier this year, amid the onslaught of news about the war in Ukraine, people began sharing infographics and articles about how we can practise "self-care" in the wake of distressing news. Of course, for some people with existing mental health issues and those who have lived in active war zones,, this kind of news cycle can obviously be deeply upsetting, triggering, and traumatising — and in those cases, self-care is important. But when it comes people were centring themselves and taking attention/focus away from the people experiencing systemic racism and losing family members in a war — but because it was underpinned in this idea of "self-care," we were meant to think it was ok.

Even earlier, in 2019, a Twitter thread focussed on a text conversation between friends, which included a copy and paste template for how you can tell someone via text that you don’t have the capacity listen to them vent, went viral. In the thread, the OP discussed how they used this interaction with their friend to "set boundaries" in terms of venting, but was subsequently meme’d because, like other clinical terms under social media’s version of self-care’s umbrella, its meaning had become co-opted. The user’s text message, which she offered up as a template for others wishing to "set boundaries," read: "Hey! I'm so glad you reached out! I'm actually at capacity right now and I don't think I can hold appropriate space for you. Could we connect [later date] instead? Do you have someone else you can reach out to?" Of course, setting valid boundaries is not the problem here, but as many responses to this thread pointed out, this type of self-involved mindset was "exhausting."

"Wellness culture has debased real self-care."

"Friendships shouldn't be transactional," one user wrote. "This is weird." Another described the thread as a "fundamental misunderstanding of what it means to be human," adding that "being of service to others is what relives us from the bondage of hyper individualistic "self" under capitalism." Underpinning both these examples is a very-online attempt at mental gymnastics, as people strive to justify the lack of reciprocity inherent in this version of self-care as a spiritual journey as opposed to plain old selfishness.

Trauma, sex, and relationship therapist Sally Baker tells Mashable that "wellness culture has debased real self-care," describing it as a "narcissistic call to arms." In trying to differentiate self-care from selfishness, she explained, "when it’s all about what an individual needs there’s no context; no responsibility and little or no opportunity for personal growth." Meanwhile, Sally defines "real" self-care as "intuitive," and insists that at its core, it's centred around "establishing healthy boundaries as well as respecting what is your stuff versus what is other people’s responsibility."

Villain era? Or just setting boundaries?

What’s especially interesting about the tail-end of the self-care movement is the directly-opposing counter-culture that seems to have arisen due to it. All over Twitter, we’re seeing people declare that they’re in their Fleabag and villain era, when all they’re actually doing is setting healthy boundaries with people, like not getting back with an abusive ex or refusing to let someone with sinister intentions take advantage of their good nature.

You might think the rise of the villain era further supports the need for a self-care culture: with the fact that people are struggling to even communicate their most basic needs to others being a surefire sign that more of an emphasis on self-care is the very thing we need right now.

But that’s not the truth. The problem is, people are recognising that when it comes to self-care, a lot of us are really taking that term and running with it. They're using it to excuse all kinds of actions and behaviour which, as I’ve explained, are objectively shitty things to do. This means that, contrary to promoting actions that are good for our mental health, self-care has become a dirty word, as people have learned to see the phrase as synonymous with not just selfishness, but even villainy.

So, that leaves us with this Catch-22 where people who really do need to practise self-care are anxious about doing so because they don’t want to be seen as a "villain," while those who arguably need to practise less ‘self-care’ and more care toward others feel emboldened to continue toxic patterns of behaviour.

Perhaps at the root of all of this is a need for better emotional education so that we are all able to communicate our boundaries and needs in a healthy way, but the question is, at what point does self-care become selfishness? When do we know where to draw the line?

Of course, after a tough couple of years, looking after ourselves is going to be more important than ever. The key is making sure that we don’t fall into the scam of narcissism packaged up in a pretty Instagram infographic. Maybe we can all agree on one principle: Don’t be a dick.

Last year, TikTok put together one big list of its influencers, championing the creators that have kept the platform going. Now, Meta has announced its inaugural Creators of Tomorrow class, a program aiming to showcase emerging talent across the company's platforms.

The cohort of creators span across five categories whose work will be amplified by Meta. "Redefining Community" celebrates active, niche online groups and those supporting marginalized people, while "#NoFilter Empowerment" platforms creators that are "driving honest conversations" and exhibiting vulnerability online in order to fight stigma. "On the Rise" looks at creators turning their passions into careers, and "Creative Excellence" highlights creators that are "pioneers" of trends and culture. Finally, "Future Ready" focuses on creators in the Web3 space, be it the Metaverse, augmented and virtual reality, or blockchain.

This year's class consists of 25 creators with five under each category. Influencers include financial literacy coach Vivian Tu ( @your.richbff ), influencer Armiel Chandler ( @armielchandler ), musician Jayo ( @jayo ), makeup artist Paige Piskin ( @paigepiskin ), and actor and creator Joe Ando Hirsh ( @joeandohirsh ).

The initiative fits into a larger push to support creators, without whom so many of these platforms would falter.

Take a look at the full list below.

Elon Musk, the newly crowned Chief Twit, wants people to pony up for that blue check.

It's been reported that Musk is considering making verification a Twitter Blue feature, while also ramping up the cost of the service to $20 per month. In effect, Twitter would essentially be charging its users for verification — and most of the internet is convinced they wouldn't pay up. Because who would pay for a silly little check mark?

The jokes about it were good, to be honest.

Others were offended at the idea that Twitter would charge for a verification, a process that was created to protect against identity theft on the app.

Meanwhile, some users were pointing out that this new verification plan could be a nightmare for disinformation. For example, many journalists on the app are verified in an attempt to help users discern if info on Twitter is coming from a reliable source.

As a journalist, I am verified on Twitter. And unless my work requires it — and pays for it — there is a zero point zero percent chance I will pay to keep my verification. One: That is a ridiculously high price. Two: A single cent would be too much. Sure, verification is nice for work and probably boosts the visibility of my account, but paying to keep a blue check? That is extreme loser behavior. No way.

Anyway follow me @timmarcin — it's the real me, check mark or not.
Elon Musk, the newly crowned Chief Twit, wants people to pony up for that blue check.

It's been reported that Musk is considering making verification a Twitter Blue feature, while also ramping up the cost of the service to $20 per month. In effect, Twitter would essentially be charging its users for verification — and most of the internet is convinced they wouldn't pay up. Because who would pay for a silly little check mark?

The jokes about it were good, to be honest.

UPDATE: Nov. 1, 2022, 9:32 a.m. EDT Instagram said this issue has since been resolved and provided the following statement regarding the error: "We’ve resolved this bug now – it was causing people in different parts of the world to have issues accessing their accounts and caused a temporary change for some in number of followers."

Something is going on at Instagram.

If you've been locked out of your account or have recently received a message that your account was suspended, don't worry too much. You're not alone.

Users have been reporting Instagram outages over the past 24 hours and many users have tweeted that their Instagram accounts have been suspended without cause. It's unclear what, exactly, is creating the issues. But Instagram confirmed on Twitter that there's an issue that's blocking some users from accessing their accounts — so even though the app might say you're banned, it's probably not permanent.

When contacted for comment, an Instagram representative directed us to the below tweet.

"We're aware that some of you are having issues accessing your Instagram account," Instagram comms tweeted. "We're looking into it and apologize for the inconvenience. #instagramdown"

This is a pretty wild outage. Over the weekend, Instagram was down for some users and was crashing throughout the day on Sunday. But the combination of a mass suspension and people saying they've lost hundreds of followers in one night adds up to a very odd issue.

For now, it seems like the best bet is to wait it out — and complain on Twitter.

When a commercial rocket blew up seconds after lifting off the Virginia coast in 2014, no one got hurt, and NASA replaced the necessary supplies bound for the space station.

Few people realized then, though, the cascading fallout of that explosion. The future of human-led Mars exploration hung in the balance: Without that rocket, NASA's Langley Research Center no longer had a ride for testing its $93 million inflatable heat shield in space — the hardware under development for landing astronauts on Mars in the 2030s, Joe Del Corso, the project manager at Langley, told Mashable.

"We got shut down," he said.

But someone outside of the U.S. space agency had been paying attention. Bernard Kutter, then-chief technologist for rocket builder United Launch Alliance, offered a solution to keep the experiment afloat. Now the Low-Earth Orbit Flight Test of an Inflatable Decelerator — LOFTID for short — is expected to launch on a ULA Atlas V rocket from Vandenberg Space Force Base as early as Nov. 9. Though it's not the only reason for this launch — a new weather observatory for tracking storms worldwide is also on board — NASA will be able to use the flight to perform a crucial demonstration for the Martian landing hardware.

"This only happened because he approached us right after Orb-3 [exploded] and said, 'I got an idea. We can use this. If we give you a ride, can you show it works?'" Del Corso said. "We said, 'We'll do it.'"

Kutter, an engineer who many in aerospace technology have described as a visionary, died on Aug.12, 2020, before he could see through the mission. His family never got clear answers on why his heart suddenly stopped that morning. He was 55.

Little-known to the public, the NASA inflatable heat shield test that will soon travel around Earth over the North and South poles will also fly some of Kutter's cremated remains, fulfilling one of his lifelong dreams to travel in space. The Latin words ad astra, meaning "to the stars," are written on the capsule holding his ashes.

Kutter will be among the few people whose ashes have traveled in space, sometimes referred to as a "space burial." Sixteen years ago, NASA's New Horizons spacecraft lifted off on the first journey to Pluto with the ashes of Clyde Tombaugh, the man credited with discovering it a century ago.

"'If we give you a ride, can you show it works?'"

Space 'burials'

But as the commercial space economy expands with more companies like Elon Musk's SpaceX and Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin, space memorials could become a lot more common, particularly if the cost of spaceflight continues to drop, said Charles Chafer, CEO of Celestis, a private company that has conducted 18 such missions since 1997. Celestis has provided these services for about 1,500 deceased individuals, including the late Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry, and expects that number to rise to 2,000 by the end of this year.

The ashes hitch rides on rockets as secondary payloads, meaning they aren't the main reason the mission is flying. Celestis used to average one flight every 1.5 years. Now it has five flights scheduled in the coming 14 months. Chafer attributes the surge in demand to the increased ease in accessing space and the steady growth in cremation as a burial alternative.

The company serves people who usually fall into at least one of three groups: They love space, they have a spiritual desire to become one with the cosmos, or their families want to give them a gigantic send-off.

"What I tell people is you'll never see as much cheering and high-fiving at a funeral as you do at our services," Chafer told Mashable.

A suborbital flight that would bring the ashes back to surviving family members starts at $2,500, and a flight into Earth's orbit, which would end with the contents eventually vaporizing upon re-entering the atmosphere, starts at $5,000. A mission into deep space would run upward of $12,500, according to the company's website.

Celestis has never "released" ashes into space the way sailors scatter them at sea, nor does it want to.

"We are space-sustainability freaks here, if you will," said Chafer, emphasizing their aversion to introducing more debris in space. "Once you start releasing stuff in orbit, it's all going 17,000 miles an hour, so it can do a lot of damage."

For Kayla Kutter, NASA and ULA's tribute to her father will mean attending her first rocket launch. Despite his career in rockets, she and many of her family members have never been to one before. Kayla, her husband, brother, mother, uncle, and grandmother plan to be in California for the event to see off the mission that also has been formally named after Kutter.

When her dad was three, he watched the television broadcast of the first Apollo moon landing with his mother. Not understanding the unprecedented significance of the moment, he asked her if she had ever been there before. Of course, she told him she hadn't. From then on, he had his heart and mind set.

"His dream was to take his mom to space," she said.

Why an inflatable heat shield

Before Kutter died, his work concentrated on finding new ways to make space travel more affordable. From afar, he watched what NASA's Langley was doing with the Hypersonic Inflatable Aerodynamic Decelerator, or HIAD project, knowing it could be a valuable technology for ULA.

Since the first uncrewed Viking mission to Mars over 50 years ago, engineers have used the same rigid heat shield to land spacecraft on the Red Planet. Even NASA's Curiosity and Perseverance rovers, which landed in 2012 and 2021, used a hard shell for their heat shields, a design limited in size by the rocket's nose cone.

But the bigger the heat shield, the more drag it can pull out of the Martian atmosphere to land heavier loads of cargo — and, one day, astronauts — on the surface. That same technology could help ULA achieve its goals of bringing back heavy cargo from low-Earth orbit and salvaging some of its most expensive hardware.

If an inflatable heat shield could allow the company to reuse rocket engines, Kutter knew that would be a gamechanger. He had already started penciling in where an inflatable heat shield would go on the new Vulcan engines the company was using, Del Corso said.

As Kutter mulled how to lead the company into the future cislunar economy, the evolving marketplace between Earth and the moon, he rarely talked about such things with his family. At home, he was more focused on how to support his children and their interests.

"He was always very present with us," Kayla said. "Whatever role he had at ULA or his job or stressors, he didn't bring that to us."

The concepts of life and death in most games are represented by the ability to keep playing, or the need to stop and start over. In Supermassive Games' most recent lost-in-the-woods monster adventure The Quarry, death is an intrinsic part of the fun, like in a horror movie. "It's less of a game that you can win and more of a movie that you can play. The people that get it, get it. And they love it," game director Will Byles told Mashable.

To be sure, Supermassive is playing in the same sandbox — branching, player-authored adventures — as others, particularly Telltale Games. In Telltale's hit The Walking Dead series, you're making choices that, over time, steer character relationships and shape the narrative around different outcomes. It's a story that is ultimately shaped by your personal sensibilities, and the final result feels like something close to fan fiction.

By contrast, most of Supermassive's games, like Until Dawn, the Dark Pictures Anthology series, and The Quarry are all horror stories through and through. Your fingerprint is there, but the individualized experience lives in a state of perpetual tension with the trope-y thrills of a monster movie, and familiar horror movie thought exercises become gameplay. Do you take a path that you know will keep a particular person safe? Or do you have them hide under that nearby bed, where you're certain they'll be discovered and dispatched in gruesome fashion? The Quarry and its ilk let you play out the answers to those kinds of questions.

In short, stories from Supermassive Games just hit different, and here's an in-depth look at why.

Finding the game in a movie script

It all starts with a script. Byles put The Quarry together originally as a 90-page feature script, written in the widely used screenwriting application Final Draft. No branches, no choices, just the story of what happens when a bunch of camp counselors get stranded in the remote woods as a monstrous threat lurks in the shadows.

"It's got a kind of canonical journey that goes through [the story beats], and all the scenes that are in the game are in there," Byles said. "Very condensed, but that allows me to pull character relationships together."

Particularly at this early stage, it's important to have a coherent and broadly relatable foundation to the story, so there's a stable root structure before the story starts to branch. Byles will "freely, happily" lean on established story structures like Joseph Campbell's "hero's journey" as his starting point in the canonical script.

"All that sort of stuff is a good guide to make sure that the story is engaging and that it has a good core," Byles said. "In terms of every single one of those beats [in the script], what would we do to branch that?" That's the question Byles grapples with again and again during story development, alongside narrative designers, storyboard artists, the production designer, and the art director.

To keep everything organized, the Supermassive team uses what Byles describes as a "storyboarding tool," which was built in-house. The Supermassive-authored software acts as a centralized interface for tools that handle scriptwriting, video and sound editing, art, and more, tying the big picture together in a color-coded "GameFlow" chart that maps out the course of the story and the rippling impacts of each choice that players make.

This is what the full story of The Quarry looks like with every possible player choice and story branch accounted for in Supermassive's GameFlow chart. It's almost incomprehensible in this zoomed out view, but each of those boxes correlates to a specific moment or action in-game.

Supermassive's storyboarding tool keeps the GameFlow chart accessible in its own window. The development team then zooms in closer on specific chapters, scenes, and even choices to make tweaks and test results.

It's easier to understand the different pieces and how they come together in a more zoomed in look at the chart. Here's The Quarry's full prologue in GameFlow form.

The green squares are scripted cutscenes. Players can't alter the outcome once they reach one of these. "As a rule, we never want them to be more than a page long, which is roughly a minute [of playing time]. We want people to be constantly feeling that they're engaged."

Each box in the GameFlow chart is color-coded according to its purpose. Orange boxes are choices, so they'll often branch out in multiple directions. When there's a timed element to any given choice, a branch with a clock icon points to the result that plays out when players don't make a choice before time is up.

Blue boxes branch out as well, but the boxes themselves correlate to "Quick Time Events" (QTEs). These gameplay moments challenge players to follow on screen control prompts on a timer, often in the context of an escape sequence or some other action, and the branches lead to story results of success versus failure in each QTE.

Red boxes are used for combat moments, which are more prevalent in The Quarry than they've been in most of the past Supermassive titles. Purple boxes represent exploration moments where players get to wander in the shoes of one character or another. And those big yellow boxes that wrap around certain sets of smaller ones have no gameplay purpose; they're simply developer notes, often serving to fill in any missing context.

The storyboarding tool Supermassive employs is essential for keeping the scope and focus of a project like The Quarry in view as it evolves from a feature-length script into a sprawling, choice-driven video game. Using the GameFlow chart, developers can zoom all the way into any particular box and tweak various in-game elements right there on the spot.

Burying canon in the woods

"It's like a writing room, really," Byles said of Supermassive's tool. "We can sit there live and type into it and sketch into it, and we can flesh out the story as we go along. Music, we can think about. All that stuff."

Byles added, "It's lovely, it's collaborative, but it's also directed, because we know what the story is."

A still-in-development game is even playable at this stage, albeit in rough and unfinished form. But the ability to string together storyboard art, music, voice lines delivered by robots or bad actors, and fully animated, near-final/final footage into something the team can interact with and "play" is instructive for the process.

"You can get an idea of how long the scene's gonna last," Byles said, adding that the rough presentation can actually be instructive in this context. "If it's exciting at this stage, it'll definitely get more exciting once you make it real. And if it's dull at this stage, no matter how much you polish it up, it's gonna stay dull. Making it 3D [...] won't help a weak story." Byles' original, un-branching, story provides the narrative energy for unchanging plot points.

And there is a path through the story that takes the player on the story the director first envisioned. "It's not a happy ending," Byles said of his original script. "It's not everyone living by any means, [and] it's full of all sorts of twists and turns." But while seeing that canonical version of The Quarry is technically doable, players would need a detailed roadmap.

"We did at one point think about releasing a thing that [would take you through the canon plot] if you actually hit every single [choice]," Byles said. The idea was to include some sort of audiovisual indicator that would point players to each of those correct-for-the-plot choices.

"It would be nigh-on impossible to catch every one. So it seemed a little unfair," Byles said, adding, "There's always a chance that we might DLC something." This "official" version, wouldn't just be some statement of authorial ownership, however, and could actually offer important clarity to fans. After all, said Byles, "If you don't have a canonical story, then how can you make a sequel to it?"

What's next for playable horror movies?

It's easy to forget that Supermassive is essentially writing the rulebook and the rules of play as it goes. For as much as Until Dawn, The Quarry, and The Dark Pictures Anthology all share DNA with choice-driven adventures from the likes of Telltale, your choices serve a different purpose here. The Quarry and its ilk turn the rules of horror into a video game.

"That really is it," Byles said of Supermassive's guiding philosophy. "We're making a horror movie that you can play." The Quarry is the latest example of how the studio delivers on that promise, but it's also the best one to date.

"We're going to really lean into that now," he added. "This genre [of game] is maturing. It was a real punt with Until Dawn, and then with this one it felt like it solidified."

Byles may have offered a hint about next steps when he emphasized his interest in the way the player's personality brings different kinds of narrative texture to the plot. "Whether or not you want to be a douche, or if you want to be a hero. I think that's a really interesting thing," Byles said. "The sort of person you are allows for a whole bunch of different styles of playing."

Take the example of the prologue moment when Laura and Max, the two stars for that stretch of story, interact with a local cop after a mysterious circumstance led to a car crash. Your choices during that sequence don't materially influence the plot in an unchangeable way; they exist more to add color. Byles loves to see where players end up going in moments like this.

"Watching what people do when the cop, Travis, is talking to them — whether they are super honest and polite or whether they're irreverent and a little bit rude — is interesting because there's no context for it either way. It's just about your personality," Byles said.

"How that changes the relationship and affects things as [the game] goes on is not massive — it's certainly there, but it's a contextual thing. I love that," Byles said. "So it's not just the horror side of it; it's the horror and the relationships, and the consequences of both."

The Quarry is now available for PC, PlayStation, and Xbox.

The green squares are scripted cutscenes. Players can't alter the outcome once they reach one of these. "As a rule, we never want them to be more than a page long, which is roughly a minute [of playing time]. We want people to be constantly feeling that they're engaged."

Each box in the GameFlow chart is color-coded according to its purpose. Orange boxes are choices, so they'll often branch out in multiple directions. When there's a timed element to any given choice, a branch with a clock icon points to the result that plays out when players don't make a choice before time is up.

Blue boxes branch out as well, but the boxes themselves correlate to "Quick Time Events" (QTEs). These gameplay moments challenge players to follow on screen control prompts on a timer, often in the context of an escape sequence or some other action, and the branches lead to story results of success versus failure in each QTE.

Red boxes are used for combat moments, which are more prevalent in The Quarry than they've been in most of the past Supermassive titles. Purple boxes represent exploration moments where players get to wander in the shoes of one character or another. And those big yellow boxes that wrap around certain sets of smaller ones have no gameplay purpose; they're simply developer notes, often serving to fill in any missing context.

The storyboarding tool Supermassive employs is essential for keeping the scope and focus of a project like The Quarry in view as it evolves from a feature-length script into a sprawling, choice-driven video game. Using the GameFlow chart, developers can zoom all the way into any particular box and tweak various in-game elements right there on the spot.

Burying canon in the woods

"It's like a writing room, really," Byles said of Supermassive's tool. "We can sit there live and type into it and sketch into it, and we can flesh out the story as we go along. Music, we can think about. All that stuff."

Byles added, "It's lovely, it's collaborative, but it's also directed, because we know what the story is."

A still-in-development game is even playable at this stage, albeit in rough and unfinished form. But the ability to string together storyboard art, music, voice lines delivered by robots or bad actors, and fully animated, near-final/final footage into something the team can interact with and "play" is instructive for the process.

"You can get an idea of how long the scene's gonna last," Byles said, adding that the rough presentation can actually be instructive in this context. "If it's exciting at this stage, it'll definitely get more exciting once you make it real. And if it's dull at this stage, no matter how much you polish it up, it's gonna stay dull. Making it 3D [...] won't help a weak story." Byles' original, un-branching, story provides the narrative energy for unchanging plot points.

And there is a path through the story that takes the player on the story the director first envisioned. "It's not a happy ending," Byles said of his original script. "It's not everyone living by any means, [and] it's full of all sorts of twists and turns." But while seeing that canonical version of The Quarry is technically doable, players would need a detailed roadmap.

"We did at one point think about releasing a thing that [would take you through the canon plot] if you actually hit every single [choice]," Byles said. The idea was to include some sort of audiovisual indicator that would point players to each of those correct-for-the-plot choices.

"It would be nigh-on impossible to catch every one. So it seemed a little unfair," Byles said, adding, "There's always a chance that we might DLC something." This "official" version, wouldn't just be some statement of authorial ownership, however, and could actually offer important clarity to fans. After all, said Byles, "If you don't have a canonical story, then how can you make a sequel to it?"

What's next for playable horror movies?

It's easy to forget that Supermassive is essentially writing the rulebook and the rules of play as it goes. For as much as Until Dawn, The Quarry, and The Dark Pictures Anthology all share DNA with choice-driven adventures from the likes of Telltale, your choices serve a different purpose here. The Quarry and its ilk turn the rules of horror into a video game.

"That really is it," Byles said of Supermassive's guiding philosophy. "We're making a horror movie that you can play." The Quarry is the latest example of how the studio delivers on that promise, but it's also the best one to date.

"We're going to really lean into that now," he added. "This genre [of game] is maturing. It was a real punt with Until Dawn, and then with this one it felt like it solidified."

Byles may have offered a hint about next steps when he emphasized his interest in the way the player's personality brings different kinds of narrative texture to the plot. "Whether or not you want to be a douche, or if you want to be a hero. I think that's a really interesting thing," Byles said. "The sort of person you are allows for a whole bunch of different styles of playing."

Take the example of the prologue moment when Laura and Max, the two stars for that stretch of story, interact with a local cop after a mysterious circumstance led to a car crash. Your choices during that sequence don't materially influence the plot in an unchangeable way; they exist more to add color. Byles loves to see where players end up going in moments like this.

"Watching what people do when the cop, Travis, is talking to them — whether they are super honest and polite or whether they're irreverent and a little bit rude — is interesting because there's no context for it either way. It's just about your personality," Byles said.

"How that changes the relationship and affects things as [the game] goes on is not massive — it's certainly there, but it's a contextual thing. I love that," Byles said. "So it's not just the horror side of it; it's the horror and the relationships, and the consequences of both."

The Quarry is now available for PC, PlayStation, and Xbox.
This Halloween, in the midst of Wordle-inspired costumes and general mayhem, something stood out to me: my friend Temujin carrying a point-and-shoot digital camera, the kind that dominated the 2000s before smartphone cameras took reign. He was using his mother's camera, he explains, but he's taken it for his own now. Throughout the night, we turned to the silver Canon IXUS 177, eliciting reactions that all sat on the plane of appreciation: "That's such a good idea," was the overwhelming consensus.

"All of my childhood memorabilia was taken on a digital and so they hold a real nostalgic principle to me," Temujin, a fashion communications student, tells me. "Last year, I noticed the rise in people commemorating the digital camera across social media."

The digital compact camera is indeed facing a distinctive revival, and not only because Instagram-savvy celebrities like Bella Hadid, Charlie D’Amelio, Nicola Peltz Beckham, and Emily Ratajkowski are engaging with this nostalgic device. As with most obsessions these days, TikTok is largely a force behind the revitalisation of the digicam.

Hundreds of videos and millions of views dedicated to the subject of digital cameras. On the app, the term "digital camera trend" has 137.3 million views; "vintage digital camera" has 177.3 million views while "cheap digital camera" has 26.5 million views. The hashtag #digitalcamera has 128.1 million and counting.

Videos under the subject document the use of these cameras and evidence the aesthetic value of the trend. TikTok user @haileyhuynhh posted a video of her pink Canon Powershot SD1200 writing in the caption, "i need to start taking more pictures on this omg". Lifestyle influencer @mia.dson shared a video of the pictures she took on an old Sony digital camera. The account @digicamgirl_ is dedicated to "old digicams", where a range of vintage camera finds are posted; in one video, the user wrote, "this trend tho!".

Others post "this is your sign to buy a cheap digital camera" videos, like user @ericamanzoli, who captioned her post "Digital>>" and shared a digital album of vacation pictures, complete with orange timestamps that unlock memories of another era in technology. Some videos help fellow TikTokkers find such cameras, noting eBay, Amazon, and other online marketplaces as key destinations, particularly for the pieces that are no longer being made. On eBay, it appears hardly any device exceeds $20, likely why TikTok champions such cameras as "cheap" and easy, while Amazon has slightly more expensive options that notably aren't pre-owned. The aesthetic of these TikToks often mirror digital cameras themselves: grainy, muted, and cloaked in nostalgia.

Somewhere on the spectrum of analog, digital, and smartphone, digicams were lost in our collective cultural consciousness. In 2018, the compact digital camera garnered attention once again, with accounts like @digicam.love on Instagram shifting newfound focus on the camera. Still, the use of the digicam paled in comparison to the fascination with film and Polaroid cameras — which both millennials and Gen-Z would agree have been dominant in the last few years.

The digicam is just the latest in a line of "old" pieces of technology that are facing renewed interest at the hands of a generation fuelled by nostalgia. Gen-Z has been noted to bring back wired earphones — dismissing the rise of AirPods — the Tamagotchi, and flip phones. Technology, as an ever and rapidly-changing world, provides much to be nostalgic for: the trend-cycle is arguably too short and beloved products are abruptly replaced with updated versions, if not altogether discontinued. Our eagerness to cling onto and restore aesthetics, objects, and technology can therefore be seen as natural.

They also evoke a sense of simplicity: these cameras are intuitive and low-maintenance, without the endless possibilities of filters and edit tools.

This time is no different. The digicam is a facet of Y2K fashion, integral to the era of mini skirts, hot pink, and rhinestones. They also evoke a sense of simplicity: these cameras are intuitive and low-maintenance, without the endless possibilities of filters and edit tools. Photo dumps and 0.5 selfies are similar in their function: for social media to appear less curated and more faithful to the moment (ahem, BeReal). While digicams cater to this desire, they offer another layer to it, in that users have to take additional steps to upload their photographs online, instead of instantly posting through a smartphone camera. This pace of consuming media is far from what we experience today, but an approach Gen-Z increasingly seeks.

The irony is that TikTok, as a form of social media, and digital cameras could not be more different when it comes to their vibes. Arguably, they are at odds with one another. The Gen-Z mecca of dance videos and niche communities is worlds apart from that metallic piece of tech favoured by families on vacation. But the former is leading to the resurgence of the latter, as TikTok continues to platform sentimentality and spark affection for the past.

As some strive for authenticity, digital cameras may provide a pathway to accomplishing just that. On a night out or on holiday, the frame in front of you is exactly what you get, with the added benefit of a retro aesthetic. TikTok itself could never.

Sitting at the bar after a comedy open mic, a couple of male comics asked me about sex parties. A joke I’d tried on stage about one experience had sparked their curiosities. After the usual questions about participation requirements, gender ratios, and voyeurism etiquette, one guy asked me how consent works at a play party. This led to a broader conversation about consent, and then gender, and then male entitlement.

I was pleasantly surprised by the scene: three straight-seeming cisgender dude-comedians at a bar trading notes about how to make consent sexy on a first date. We compared and contrasted ideas about when to ask for that first kiss and when you can just trust the vibe to lean in, citing the infamous 90-10 rule from Will Smith’s 2005 comedy Hitch.

I should mention that in this piece, I’ll be using ‘man’ as a shorthand for cisgender guys who date women. We’re not the only ones who can be shitty, but the overwhelming amount of shared experiences of women who date dudes makes the problem being discussed and its possible causes seem particularly cis, het/bi, and male.

The measurement for sexual prowess tends to be measured in pussies smashed, not pleasure caused.

When you think about a group of dudes talking to each other about sex, you might imagine tales of conquest while everyone pretends to know how to handle a clitoris. I remember quietly sitting in an NYU dorm room sophomore year hearing a bunch of frat guys add up their ‘sex scores’ based on a variety of rules like how many times you can repeat points with one chick and how many points you get for anal. Never did they mention points for bringing her to orgasm. It all felt icky. Is this how men talk to each other about sex?

What is locker room talk?

The measurement for sexual prowess tends to be measured in pussies smashed, not pleasure caused; women conquered, not women left whole when you leave. Men ask for your body count but not your strategy for figuring out her body. It’s what we all heard happen on that Access Hollywood tape between Billy Bush and Donald Trump. Tens of millions of Americans in 2016 accepted that that’s just how men talk to each other. "It’s just locker room talk," they said (despite countless pro athletes publicly pushing back against the characterization). So what was that all about?

In Cleo Stiller’s book, Modern Manhood , she writes about how traditional male friendships are structured by "creating in-groups at the expense of out-groups." The other team, the other guy, the other company, the other gender.

"Friendships between males has often been centered around an external force," says Dan Doty, who runs the men’s support group EVRYMAN , in Stiller’s book. “Men build identities based on this external thing, and when that external thing no longer is strong or it shifts or it’s not the same anymore, then we are left kind of hanging.” In lieu of connecting with each other based on who they are, many men jump to the (assumed) shared topic of chicks. It’s the source of any one man in a bar turning to another man and saying, “Women, am I right?”

Make female orgasms part of locker room talk

Comedian Clint Coley doesn’t need his buddies to know about his sex life. The urge to ‘feel cool’ with ‘locker room talk’ is long past him. And since entering his 30s, he doesn’t need to hear his buddies brag to him either. "I got a homeboy who does like to tell me what he has going on. I always tell him, 'Nobody cares.'"

Coley launched his dating podcast Advice from a F*ck Boy in 2019 to help women avoid emotionally immature men. "Sex is taught [to boys] as a selfish sport," he shares. At the same time, many women stress out about satisfying their man in the bedroom. They exchange tips, techniques, and ideas on how to give the best blowjob. Cosmopolitan has been pumping out (both good and laughably bad) sex advice to women for decades. (Editor's note: Mashable has an informative and reliable sex advice series called Come Again, which is well worth your time.) Adult sex ed platforms like Beducated attract mostly women and only the most curious men, per audience figures seen by Mashable.

Meanwhile, "when men are talking to their homeboys about sex, we’re not talking about new ways to please women," says the LA-based podcaster . "We’re talking about new ways to get our shit off. It’s not about [their] pleasure; it’s about your own ego." And why not? When ejaculation brags go unchallenged, there isn’t much reason to think you’re doing it wrong.

Do men experience empathy during sex?

There is an empathy gap afoot. And research can’t find a genetic reason for it. "Neurologically we are all born with a very similar ability to empathize, male and female, but our choice to use this ability varies greatly," writes Mimi Nicklin, a thought leader on empathy and author of Softening the Edge. "Observed gender differences are more likely to be…due to cultural expectations of gender roles and the fact that women are more likely to have been ‘taught’ empathy by female role models as they grew up."

How do we teach men to give a shit? For one thing, teaching consent can instill empathy in boys if you get there quick enough. According to a post on Prevent Child Abuse Vermont’s website, "Empathy learning occurs in the same parts of the brain as learning to speak and read." The post goes on to say, "Empathy is being able to stand in another person’s shoes and care about their feelings."

It should feel jarring to have sex with someone if you don’t think they’re having a good time. Alarm bells should go off to try a different technique or to verbally check in. Sadly, efforts to introduce these lessons in schools (e.g. teaching kids to ask permission before hugging the new kid) is often met with pushback from abstinence-only advocates who lob false accusations of "grooming."

To fill the void left by most school districts, young people turn to the internet. But on the same platforms as ConsentTok are influencers teaching boys that they are 'high-value men' entitled to great sex from hot women. For every young man who stumbles upon a sex educator’s TikTok, there’s another who instead finds an Andrew Tate-type preaching misogyny masked as men’s self-improvement. These guys will teach you how to get a woman into bed but they won’t teach you what to do once you get there.

And so often, the tactics to bed a woman turn her into a target instead of a connection. In the course of getting what they want, men can forget that there’s a human being on the other end of their desires.

Talk to your buddies about sex—better

I asked Coley where he learned how to empathize with women. "A woman." Damn. Because I hear women are tired of having to teach us. A friend of mine told me about a recent date-turned-argument with a man where she had to explain male privilege. After an hour, he admitted that he hadn’t thought about it like that before and asked if they could go back to enjoying their wine night. My friend was glad he learned something new. But now she was exhausted.

So maybe dudes can pick up the slack and question each other. Not every problematic utterance has to become a TED Talk, but one could use friendly shame to make their point. Clown on the guy who wants to compare everyone’s body counts at the next hang. "You gotta make it corny" to talk about women as objects, suggests Coley.

"We need a better check and balance system when it comes to talking about women behind their backs."

Elon Musk isn't wasting any time changing Twitter.

Not only that, he's taken the role of customer service, he's making fun at the expense of the company's inner processes, and he's discussing grand ideas and massive changes with his Twitter followers.

We knew Musk's era would be interesting times for Twitter, but judging by the Chief Twit's first three days of reign, it will also be intense.

Take, as an example, Musk's latest tweet (at writing time). In a poll, he's asking his followers whether Twitter should bring back Vine, a short video sharing service it acquired in 2012 and shut down in 2016.

YouTuber MrBeast chimes in with a comment. "If you did that and actually competed with tik tok that’d be hilarious," he says. "What could we do to make it better than TikTok," Musk replies.

And there you go: Musk is casually spitballling ideas about bringing back a long-dead video sharing service, a feat that would no doubt cost Twitter a fair amount of money, with random people on the internet.

Given the pace Twitter has gone about making certain changes to the site (we're looking at you, edit button), it's almost understandable that Musk wants to move things at a different pace. And he's not stopping at suggestions. As first reported by The Verge, Musk already overrode some internal circuit breakers to make an important change to Twitter's homepage, which now shows trending tweets and news stories for logged-out users, instead of just a big prompt to log into (or sign up for) the service.

Echoing the way he sometimes handles user complaints about Tesla vehicles, Musk also replied to a few users promising he'll help out with their user account issues on Twitter.

In the last 24 hours, Musk has also made fun of an automated, internal email that prompted him to start a management tutorial, hinted at plans to make verification a subscription-only feature while also mentioning the verification process is being "revamped right now," promised to allow for longer videos on the platform, and said character limits, one of Twitter's main traits, would "absolutely" be removed. How's that for three days' work?

With key execs out of the picture and reports of more layouts incoming, it's hard to say how quickly can Musk's ideas (and his followers' ideas) get implemented. But it doesn't appear Musk is willing to wait very long before introducing new features — even if a few things break along the way.

Not only that, he's taken the role of customer service, he's making fun at the expense of the company's inner processes, and he's discussing grand ideas and massive changes with his Twitter followers.

We knew Musk's era would be interesting times for Twitter, but judging by the Chief Twit's first three days of reign, it will also be intense.

Take, as an example, Musk's latest tweet (at writing time). In a poll, he's asking his followers whether Twitter should bring back Vine, a short video sharing service it acquired in 2012 and shut down in 2016.

YouTuber MrBeast chimes in with a comment. "If you did that and actually competed with tik tok that’d be hilarious," he says. "What could we do to make it better than TikTok," Musk replies.

And there you go: Musk is casually spitballling ideas about bringing back a long-dead video sharing service, a feat that would no doubt cost Twitter a fair amount of money, with random people on the internet.

Given the pace Twitter has gone about making certain changes to the site (we're looking at you, edit button), it's almost understandable that Musk wants to move things at a different pace. And he's not stopping at suggestions. As first reported by The Verge, Musk already overrode some internal circuit breakers to make an important change to Twitter's homepage, which now shows trending tweets and news stories for logged-out users, instead of just a big prompt to log into (or sign up for) the service.

Echoing the way he sometimes handles user complaints about Tesla vehicles, Musk also replied to a few users promising he'll help out with their user account issues on Twitter.

In the last 24 hours, Musk has also made fun of an automated, internal email that prompted him to start a management tutorial, hinted at plans to make verification a subscription-only feature while also mentioning the verification process is being "revamped right now," promised to allow for longer videos on the platform, and said character limits, one of Twitter's main traits, would "absolutely" be removed. How's that for three days' work?

With key execs out of the picture and reports of more layouts incoming, it's hard to say how quickly can Musk's ideas (and his followers' ideas) get implemented. But it doesn't appear Musk is willing to wait very long before introducing new features — even if a few things break along the way.
Henry Selick and Jordan Peele’s Wendell & Wild is a triumph of animation. From its themes to its art style, the film is a unique love letter to animated movies and all the ways they grip our hearts as kids and as adults. But above all, Wendell & Wild is a cornucopia of inclusivity, with its secret standout shining through Raúl (Sam Zelaya), the film's lead trans character.

Wendell & Wild follows Kat Elliot (Lyric Ross), a teenage hell maiden who summons two demons from the underworld, Wendell (Keegan-Michael Key) and Wild (Jordan Peele), in hopes that they’ll bring her parents back to life. It's a simple premise that soon becomes a whirlwind of adventure, hell-risen mishaps, and a profound commentary on the carceral system. While the film takes on both fantastical and painfully real horrors, its thematic through line is allowed to breathe through its wonderfully diverse cast of characters. From Kat being a young Black girl refreshingly allowed to be angry at the world’s horrors, all the way to every single one of her peers at the Rust Bank Catholic School for Girls, Wendell & Wild is a blueprint for how to do representation right. And Raúl’s story is a remarkable bit of inclusion that doesn’t feel forced, wronged, or — more importantly — tokenized.

In a Q&A session hosted by Neil Gaiman following the film’s first screenings in New York, Selick shared that while the film is abundant with representation, he didn’t want a gold star for doing it all. In fact, Raúl is trans purely because he wanted a male-identifying student within the school. How do you include a boy in an all-girl school? You make them trans. Selick’s solution was so simple, and yet the first of its kind.

After sharing his ideation behind Raúl, I was dumbfounded by how easy Selick made it seem to organically include trans characters without pigeonholing them or falling into virtuous complexes. Bluntly put, it seemed so easy because it actually was that easy. An overshadowed side of inclusivity is showing people from marginalized communities in a light outside of their trauma. Is it important to talk about trauma pertaining to different groups? Absolutely. Is it still a feat of representation when the subject matter is trauma heavy? Of course. But is it also as doubly important to shed light on stories of marginalized people simply being people? A thousand times yes. And that’s exactly what Selick does.

So who exactly is Raúl? He's an incredibly talented artist who’s using his work to try and expose the evil behind the town’s prison system, Klax Korp. His mom, Marianna (Natalie Martinez), is also working as a paralegal in the town’s council to prove that Klax Korp had something to do with their town’s devastating fire. And while their linked mission makes them integral players in Kat’s journey, it also infuses Raúl’s story with stakes that have nothing to do with his gender identity. He’s an artist, he’s an activist, he’s a son, and he’s Kat’s first ever friend — who just happens to be trans.

We first meet Raúl while he's hiding in the school's bell tower and working on something that's initially unclear to us. But as the story unravels, and Kat and Raúl go to hell and back (almost quite literally) to save the day, the film's final moments reveal the mammoth task Raúl had been working on the entire time. Taking the town's rooftops as his personal canvas, Raúl had been painting a mural of a mother protecting her son from two evil, gargantuan snakes, with the latter symbolizing Klax Korp's owners. While the piece is beautiful and lends into Wendell & Wild's overall themes, it's absolutely mind-blowing that a kid made a project on that large of a scale. By Raúl's age I could make a detailed sketch at best, but an art project turning every house in my town into a canvas? That's MVP behavior.

A masterpiece!! Credit: Screenshot Netflix

Alongside his phenomenal artistic talent, Raúl is a support system for Kat throughout her entire journey as a hell maiden and as a kid grieving the loss of her parents. He helps her every step of the way, whether it's by being by her side while summoning demons, understanding where her defensive outbursts stem from, or defending her against their many antagonists without a second thought. Get you a friend that can make you laugh in detention all while battling demons with you in the very same night.

And in moments when Raúl’s gender identity is foregrounded to illuminate the audience about his journey, it’s done so beautifully with twinges of realism that’ll hopefully resonate with trans kids and their families. From including clips of his friends at school adjusting to his transition, to showcasing a scene where his mom fiercely defends him against bigots deliberately misgendering him, Wendell & Wild craftily illustrates Raúl’s reality without falling into potholes of vapid commentary. The film isn’t grabbing you by the face and introducing you to something shocking. It’s just placing you in a town and in families that probably look a whole lot like people you know — minus the whole demons and army of the dead fiasco.

Focusing primarily on Raúl's life and interests is a wonderful decision that bolsters his character with so much charm and authenticity while lessening the weight of being a rare trans character in animation. If anything, it reminds us of how seldom we see trans characters living life abundantly on screen. Raúl is a small but mighty step towards more trans inclusion in genre stories. And we sure know that it’s about time.

Happy Halloween! I've got something that's going to scare you silly: Quordle is hard today.

If Quordle is a little too challenging today, you've come to the right place for hints. There aren't just hints here, but the whole Quordle solution. Scroll to the bottom of this page, and there it is. But are you sure you need all four answers? Maybe you just need a strategy guide. Either way, scroll down, and you'll get what you need.

What is Quordle?

Quordle is a five-letter word guessing game similar to Wordle, except each guess applies letters to four words at the same time. You get nine guesses instead of six to correctly guess all four words. It looks like playing four Wordle games at the same time, and that is essentially what it is. But it's not nearly as intimidating as it sounds.

Is Quordle harder than Wordle?

Yes, though not diabolically so.

Where did Quordle come from?

Amid the Wordle boom of late 2021 and early 2022, when everyone was learning to love free, in-browser, once-a-day word guessing games, creator Freddie Meyer says he took inspiration from one of the first big Wordle variations, Dordle — the one where you essentially play two Wordles at once. He took things up a notch, and released Quordle on January 30. Meyer's creation was covered in The Guardian six days later, and now, according to Meyer, it attracts millions of daily users. Today, Meyer earns modest revenue from Patreon, where dedicated Quordle fans can donate to keep their favorite puzzle game running.

How is Quordle pronounced?

“Kwordle.” It should rhyme with “Wordle,” and definitely should not be pronounced exactly like "curdle.”

Is Quordle strategy different from Wordle?

Yes and no.

Your starting strategy should be the same as with Wordle. In fact, if you have a favorite Wordle opening word, there’s no reason to change that here. We suggest something rich in vowels, featuring common letters like C, R, and N. But you do you.

After your first guess, however, you’ll notice things getting out of control if you play Quordle exactly like Wordle.

What should I do in Quordle that I don’t do in Wordle?

Solving a Wordle puzzle can famously come down to a series of single letter-change variations. If you’ve narrowed it down to “-IGHT,” you could guess “MIGHT” “NIGHT” “LIGHT” and “SIGHT” and one of those will probably be the solution — though this is also a famous way to end up losing in Wordle, particularly if you play on “hard mode.” In Quordle, however, this sort of single-letter winnowing is a deadly trap, and it hints at the important strategic difference between Wordle and Quordle: In Quordle, you can't afford to waste guesses unless you're eliminating as many letters as possible at all times.

Guessing a completely random word that you already know isn't the solution, just to eliminate three or four possible letters you haven’t tried yet, is thought of as a desperate, latch-ditch move in Wordle. In Quordle, however, it's a normal part of the player's strategic toolset.

Is there a way to get the answer faster?

In my experience Quordle can be a slow game, sometimes dragging out longer than it would take to play Wordle four times. But a sort of blunt-force guessing approach can speed things up. The following strategy also works with Wordle if you only want the solution, and don’t care about having the fewest possible guesses:

Try starting with a series of words that puts all the vowels (including Y) on the board, along with some other common letters. We've had good luck with the three words: “NOTES,” “ACRID,” and “LUMPY.” YouTuber DougMansLand suggests four words: “CANOE,” “SKIRT,” “PLUMB,” and “FUDGY.”

Most of the alphabet is now eliminated, and you’ll only have the ability to make one or two wrong guesses if you use this strategy. But in most cases you’ll have all the information you need to guess the remaining words without any wrong guesses.

If strategy isn't helping, and you're still stumped, here are some hints:

Are there any double or triple letters in today’s Quordle words?

No.

Are any rare letters being used in today’s Quordle like Q or Z?

No.

What do today’s Quordle words start with?

I, B, O, and F.

What are the answers for today’s Quordle?

Are you sure you want to know?

There’s still time to turn back.

OK, you asked for it. The answers are:

If you just want today's word, you can jump straight to the end of this article for October 31's Wordle solution, for puzzle #499. If you'd rather work through it yourself, keep reading for some tips, tricks, and clues.

Where did Wordle come from?

Wordle was initially created by engineer Josh Wardle as a gift for his partner, though it quickly spread until it became an international phenomenon. Thousands of players across the globe tackle Wordle each day, with some fans even having created alternate versions of the daily word puzzle game. These include battle royale format Squabble, music identification game Heardle, and variations like Dordle and Quordle that make you guess multiple words at once.

The popularity of Wordle even reached such heights that the New York Times bought it earlier this year, while TikTok creators live-stream themselves playing it.

What's the best Wordle starting word?

The goal of Wordle is to have fun, and there's no right way to have fun. Just choose whatever starting word feels right to you, and don't let anyone shame you for it. However, if you want to take a more strategic approach, we have a few ideas to help you pick a word that will spark joy. One tip is to select a word that includes at least two different vowels, plus some common consonants like S, T, R, or N.

What happened to the Wordle archive?

The entire archive of past Wordles used to be available for anyone to play in glorious days gone by. Unfortunately it has since been taken down, with the website's creator stating it was done at the request of the New York Times.

Is Wordle getting harder?

If you're finding Wordle too easy, you can try enabling its Hard Mode to give your brain a tougher challenge. But Wordle isn't getting any harder by itself — it's the same difficulty that it's always been.

Why are there two different Wordle answers some days?

Wordle is a fun, collective experience specifically because everyone's solving for the same word every day. Occasionally, though, Wordle has accepted two different solutions as correct on the same day. This is because the New York Times made changes to the Wordle word list after acquiring it, and sometimes swaps out words from the original list. To ensure you're getting the right answer every day, refresh your browser before you play — the site will save your streak.

Here's a subtle hint for today's Wordle answer:

It's an adverb. (Yes, that's a pretty big hint for two letters.)

Does today's Wordle answer have a double letter?

Nope!

Today's Wordle is a 5-letter word that ends with...

The letter... Y.

Twitter's new "Chief Twit" Elon Musk is reportedly considering making verification a Twitter Blue feature, while simultaneously quadrupling the subscription service's cost. This would essentially mean charging users a monthly $20 fee to keep their blue tick badge.

Predictably, many users have indicated they'd rather just be unverified.

The new Musk Era of Twitter kicked off last week, with swift firings and a spike in slurs indicating significant changes for the company. Platformer first reported on Sunday that Twitter may soon require users to have a paid subscription to Twitter Blue in order to retain their verified status. Twitter verification gives eligible accounts a little checkmark badge authenticating their identity to others, and currently only demands the psychic cost of being on the hellsite.

On top of this, The Verge reports that there are also plans to increase the price of a Twitter Blue subscription from its already elevated $4.99 monthly cost to a whopping $19.99 per month. That's the same price as a premium Netflix subscription, but with markedly worse content.

Twitter's proposed changes could allow those who aren't verified to essentially purchase the coveted blue tick badge. Currently, Twitter only grants verified status to notable accounts from a "prominently recognized individual or brand." If the change goes through, it's probable that anyone who fulfils the other two criteria of being active on Twitter and confirming their identity will be able to get verified. This could potentially be useful in fighting disinformation and impersonation.

Unfortunately, the $19.99 per month blue tick fee takes a lot of shine off the appeal.

Once Twitter's new policy kicks in, users will have 90 days to subscribe or lose their blue tick. It's currently unclear what will happen to verified users in countries where Twitter Blue is unavailable, i.e. any country that isn't the US, Canada, Australia, or New Zealand. It's also unclear whether Musk has actually thought this through.

Twitter Blue currently allows users to edit their tweets, upload videos in 1080p, and see what articles are being shared the most in their network. It also enables accounts to use an NFT as their profile picture , because if you're paying for Twitter there is a non-zero chance you're also into crypto. Even with the addition of verification, none of this seems worth shelling out for.

It is annoying that features such as the edit function aren't simply included in Twitter's default product, but at least it has always been a paid feature. Musk's proposal to change Twitter's verification system would lock a previously free feature behind paywall — a move that has never won anyone goodwill.

Reactions to Musk's proposed change to Twitter's verification system have been derisive, to say the least.

In addition to the wild unpopularity of these changes, the way Musk has apparently gone about implementing them won't win him many friends either. According to The Verge's report, Twitter employees were reportedly told on Sunday they will be fired if the new Twitter Blue pricing and verification system aren't implemented by Nov. 7, giving them less than 10 days to do so. Work-life balance at Twitter has probably taken a massive hit.

Musk seems to think his changes to Twitter Blue will help increase the company's profits. Yet if Twitter does make verification a paid feature, it's likely that many accounts will simply let their verified status expire with no remorse. Rather than fighting disinformation, the blue tick badge will just become a signpost indicating which suckers actually signed up to pay Twitter $19.99 per month.

Even with the addition of verification, none of this seems worth shelling out for.

It is annoying that features such as the edit function aren't simply included in Twitter's default product, but at least it has always been a paid feature. Musk's proposal to change Twitter's verification system would lock a previously free feature behind paywall — a move that has never won anyone goodwill.

Reactions to Musk's proposed change to Twitter's verification system have been derisive, to say the least.

In addition to the wild unpopularity of these changes, the way Musk has apparently gone about implementing them won't win him many friends either. According to The Verge's report, Twitter employees were reportedly told on Sunday they will be fired if the new Twitter Blue pricing and verification system aren't implemented by Nov. 7, giving them less than 10 days to do so. Work-life balance at Twitter has probably taken a massive hit.

Musk seems to think his changes to Twitter Blue will help increase the company's profits. Yet if Twitter does make verification a paid feature, it's likely that many accounts will simply let their verified status expire with no remorse. Rather than fighting disinformation, the blue tick badge will just become a signpost indicating which suckers actually signed up to pay Twitter $19.99 per month.

The rumor mill about Apple launching M2-powered Macs this November was churning, but now it seems we'll have to wait until next year.

According to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, Apple isn't planning to release new versions of the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pros until the beginning of 2023. Those hoping for new Macs might have to wait until March, per Gurman's prediction. Both Gurman and Apple insider Ming-Chi Kuo said the new MacBook Pros will have the latest M2 chip and that we might get a new Mac mini also upgraded with an M2 chip.

Insiders initially expected a third round of product launches to follow Apple's September iPhone 14 event and October M2 iPad Pro, entry-level iPad, and Apple TV 4K announcement. But that is no longer the case. During last Thursday's quarterly earnings call, Apple CEO Tim Cook effectively confirmed this by saying the product line is "set" for the rest of the year. While Apple reported strong earnings this past quarter, unlike Meta, Amazon, and Snapchat which underperformed. But the tech giant is not immune to macroeconomic and supply chain woes, which possibly accounts for the delay.

The Halloween dog parade is one of those things that always lives up to the hype. Who can resist the appeal of a dog as the vehicle for their owner's creative costume expression? Whether the dogs are thrilled by the adoring attention, blissfully unaware of their participation in the joke, or begrudgingly humoring their owner with a grumpy look, it's all delightful.

While the one in Tompkins Square Park in New York City is the most famous, Halloween dog parades now take place all over. They're technically contests, but every dog in costume is a winner in our book. Here are some of our favorites, even if they didn't take home the prize.

Apparently, you're supposed to kill invasive lanternflies if you see one. This puts a whole new spin on the horror movie villain trope.

The bodega cat is iconic in New York City for keeping rats out of convenience stores (aka bodegas). This little dog doesn't look thrilled to be dressed up as a cat, but they really nailed the assignment.

Let's just hope this princess is secure on her tower of mattresses.

How can you not find this dog's costume "a-peel-ing"?

Even the Mar-a-Lago documents look cute in this context.

Call me crazy, but this pup seems to be acting the part of the doomed little boy in It.

The friendliest killer doll you've ever seen.

This little guy is raising hell and stealing hearts at the same time.

SEE ALSO: The real MVPs to follow are the pets of these 10 pro athletes

A masterclass in playing to one's strengths, this dog already looks like a lion and needed only one accessory to nail the costume.

Pugs are already kind of like of aliens, so this one works on multiple levels.

This is a furry spider we wouldn't mind petting.

Newly minted Twitter owner Elon Musk is following through on his plans to cut jobs at the tech company. According to the New York Times, managers have been asked to make a list of Twitter employees to lay off. The move could go into effect as soon as Nov. 1, the date when employees are expected to receive stock grants, which "typically represent a significant portion of employees’ pay," per the Times. Previously, Musk told investors that he plans to fire 75 percent of Twitter staff, but it is unclear how many of the 7,500 employees will be laid off.

Last week, Musk started his new job as "Chief Twit" and promptly fired top executives at Twitter including now-former CEO Parag Agrawal, CFO Ned Segal, and head of legal and public policy lead Vijaya Gadde. The executives were allegedly fired "for cause" which means they might not receive the multi-million dollar "golden parachute" severance package that employees receive when they're fired through no fault of their own.

Although the details of his plans to overhaul Twitter are vague, Musk has said that he wants to make Twitter a "digital town square" which involves making the company private, reducing content moderation, and overturning lifelong bans of Twitter accounts like former President Donald Trump. Such actions have many users worried that trolls and misinformation could run rampant, but in a message to Twitter advertisers Musk promised that Twitter would not become a "free-for-all hellscape, where anything can be said with no consequences." Musk also plans on creating a content moderation council with "widely diverse viewpoints."

As a new era of Twitter begins, the world is watching to see how these changes will pan out and if Twitter will become the "warm and welcoming" platform Musk says he intends to create.

If you've ever thought about quitting your job and starting something new, a survey from Clarity Capital about tech workers laid off during the pandemic found that might be a great idea, according to a report by Emily Dreibelbis of PCMag.com.

Of 4,188 respondents, a staggering 1,007 reported starting their own company post-layoff.

The top motivations for doing so were more professional growth (58%) and more money (52%), although not being paid enough ranked lower (35%). Perhaps they were being paid enough, but they knew they could make more while gaining new skills.

Here's why. Credit: Clarify Capital Survey

They were right. Self-employment has yielded handsome pay bumps: Founders are now making $13,000 more on average. And millennials are raking in an additional $17,535.

Here's how much more they make. Credit: Clarify Capital Survey

Still, 70% of those surveyed went through a period of remorse related to the decision. Gen Z respondents, some of whom may have left their first jobs ever to start their own companies, reported the most turmoil over their new daily grind, at 79%. They also experienced the smallest pay increase—$6,638, on average.

What lessons can we learn from all this? Data behind why former tech workers began their startups and the challenges they encountered are quite revealing.

Most respondents made the decision within a year of being laid off (72%). The ideas they chose to pursue were most often closely related to their former companies, with 91% saying they're competing directly.

Here's how long it took. Credit: Clarify Capital Survey

Most got started the old-fashioned way, by using their own money—$20,000 on average—and 70% secured investments from friends and family, mostly around $8,000. For an extra "stick it to the man" moment, 84% of new founders tapped connections from their former companies for funding.

Funding sources and challenges. Credit: Clarify Capital Survey

Acquiring customers took varying amounts of time, but most of these new businesses found it took eight months or less (68%). A fortunate subset found buyers within three months (18%).

In the end, most of these new company founders are happy with their decision. Respondents reported feeling surprised, excited, confident, and optimistic about their new venture. The majority reported having better mental health, more job security, and better work-life balance.

Happy endings are nice and all, but even the most idealistic among us know they don't always last. Sometimes, the happy ending is just the start of a larger story that ends with someone weeping into a pint of ice cream alone on the couch, flipping channels in search of something to mend a broken heart, or at least distract from the pain for a bit.

In other words, sometimes what you need is not a love story but a breakup movie. We've compiled 31 of the best breakup movies to help you process your sadness, exorcise your rage, or encourage you to dust yourself back up and move the hell on.

Here are the 31 best breakup movies streaming and where to watch them.

1. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind

They say it's better to have loved and lost, but try telling that to someone still smarting from a breakup. This trippy love story follows Joel (Jim Carrey) as he tries to wipe his ex (Kate Winslet) from his mind, only to wonder if some of those memories may be worth keeping after all.

How to watch: Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is available on iTunes.(opens in a new tab)

2. Marriage Story

A clean break may be ideal, but it isn't always an option. In Marriage Story , Charlie (Adam Driver) and Nicole (Scarlett Johansson) suffer through an ugly custody battle — and come out the other side with a new sort of relationship, one based not on sex and romance but shared parenthood.

How to watch: Marriage Story is streaming on Netflix(opens in a new tab).

3. High Fidelity

High Fidelity is the breakup movie you turn to when you've just had your heart crushed, and you've got a sneaking suspicion that at least some of it might have been your fault. But if Rob (John Cusack) can learn to grow up a little, maybe you can, too.

How to watch: High Fidelity is available on iTunes(opens in a new tab).

4. Forgetting Sarah Marshall

This film is nothing if not a promise that it'll get better. Sure, it sucks to lose your S.O., especially when she's a famous TV star whose face is plastered all over the place. But who's to say you can't rebound with an even cooler girlfriend to love, like Forgetting Sarah Marshall's Mila Kunis?

5. Midsommar

Because some breakups call for something a bit more dramatic than the usual sobfest. Some breakups come at the end of a relationship so grandly shitty, you need to travel to rural Sweden for a once-in-a-lifetime festival put on by an obscure death cult in order to really get your point across.

6. Waiting to Exhale

Waiting to Exhale combines the visceral satisfaction of setting a cheating ex's car on fire with the comforting reassurance of close-knit friendship, and serves as a gentle reminder that better things lie ahead after all the pain and suffering.

How to watch: Waiting to Exhale is available on iTunes(opens in a new tab) and Prime Video(opens in a new tab).

7. Celeste and Jesse Forever

It's a sad truth that two people can like each other very much, and still not be meant to love each other. Rashida Jones and Andy Samberg play a pair of high-school sweethearts who remain best friends after seven years of marriage, but feel the need to move on from each other romantically.

How to watch: Celeste and Jesse Forever is available on iTunes(opens in a new tab), Prime Video(opens in a new tab), and Starz(opens in a new tab).

8. The Holiday

Remember, the only reason Kate Winslet and Cameron Diaz get to stay in fabulous homes and flirt with Jack Black and Jude Law in this very charming movie is because they previously broke up with two other dudes who totally sucked.

How to watch: The Holiday is available on iTunes(opens in a new tab) and Prime Video.

9. The Souvenir

The Souvenir is an exquisite portrait of the doomed relationship between naive Julie (Honor Swinton Byrne) and the mysterious Anthony (Tom Burke), acknowledging both how difficult it can be to disentangle from a toxic relationship, and the bruises it can leave behind.

How to watch: The Souvenir is available on iTunes(opens in a new tab) and Prime Video(opens in a new tab).

10. Blue Valentine

Watching Blue Valentine while in the throes of heartbreak is like pressing down on a bruise — the pain is what makes it so satisfying. The film cuts between the tender start of Dean (Ryan Gosling) and Cindy's (Michelle Williams) romance and its jagged end, to tearjerking effect.

How to watch: Blue Valentine is available on iTunes(opens in a new tab), Prime Video(opens in a new tab), and Tubi(opens in a new tab).

11. Casablanca

Few of us get goodbyes to love as epically romantic as the one between Rick (Humphrey Bogart) and Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman). But wouldn't it be nice to imagine we did? They'll always have Paris, and we'll always have Casablanca to weep over when we're at our most tragically brokenhearted.

How to watch: Casablanca is available on iTunes(opens in a new tab), Prime Video(opens in a new tab), and HBO Max.(opens in a new tab)

12. Gone Girl

Gone Girl is about a disappearance, not a breakup — but it does have plenty to say about the hazards of modern marriage. Watch how Nick (Ben Affleck) and Amy (Rosamund Pike) went from meet-cute to fairy-tale courtship to...well, you'll see...and you may decide you're better off single.

How to watch: Gone Girl is available on iTunes(opens in a new tab) and Prime Video(opens in a new tab).

13. (500) Days of Summer

Let Tom (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) serve as a warning against looking back at past relationships with rose-colored glasses. It's only when he starts to see Summer (Zooey Deschanel) with clearer eyes that he's able to understand what went wrong, and move on to the next stage of his life.

How to watch: (500) Days of Summer (opens in a new tab)is available on iTunes and Prime Video(opens in a new tab).

14. Crazy, Stupid, Love

Crazy, Stupid, Love puts more than one of its characters through heartbreak, but its star-studded cast reminds you through swoonworthy smooches, grand romantic gestures, and one hilarious brawl that the right one is worth fighting for. (Just try to ignore the outdated gender roles.)

How to watch: Crazy, Stupid, Love is available on iTunes(opens in a new tab) and Prime Video(opens in a new tab).

15. Appropriate Behavior

Anyone who's tried to remedy a broken heart with petty confrontations and ill-advised hookups will recognize themselves in Shirin (Desiree Akhavan, who also wrote and directed) and her halfhearted attempts to get her life back together after she's dumped by her girlfriend (Rebecca Henderson).

How to watch: Appropriate Behavior is available on iTunes(opens in a new tab), Prime Video(opens in a new tab), Vudu(opens in a new tab), and Tubi(opens in a new tab).

16. Swingers

Swingers knows that what every freshly dumped person needs is a friend who'll take you out on the town, look at you in your sorry state, and remind us that you're so money and you don't even know it. If that friend has the charisma of a young Vince Vaughn, all the better.

How to watch: Swingers is available on iTunes(opens in a new tab), Prime Video(opens in a new tab), and HBO Max(opens in a new tab).

17. Closer

Here's a movie for those dark days when you find yourself wondering if love even exists, or if it's just a cruel joke designed to destroy peoples' lives. Clive Owen, Julia Roberts, Jude Law, and Natalie Portman play four people who can't stop cheating on each other, with bitter results.

How to watch: Closer is available on iTunes(opens in a new tab) and Prime Video(opens in a new tab).

18. Legally Blonde

Reese Witherspoon's Elle Woods is a role model for anyone smarting over an unappreciative ex. Just do what she does: Work your butt off to win him back, discover exactly how awesome you are in the process, and realize you never needed him in the first place. What, like it's hard?

How to watch: Legally Blonde is available on iTunes(opens in a new tab) and Prime Video(opens in a new tab).

19. The Wedding Singer

Breakups are never fun, but it can be a consolation to remember that sometimes, they're for the best. Just ask Robbie (Adam Sandler) and Julia (Drew Barrymore), both engaged to the wrong people at the start of The Wedding Singer, and both about to find out that their true loves are each other.

How to watch: The Wedding Singer is available on iTunes(opens in a new tab) and Prime Video(opens in a new tab).

20. La La Land

Er, spoilers: Breakup movie king Ryan Gosling makes his third appearance on this list as Sebastian, whose passionate relationship with Mia (Emma Stone, also in Crazy, Stupid, Love) falls apart over their divergent dreams, but leaves both of them changed for the better in the end.

How to watch: La La Land is available on iTunes(opens in a new tab) and Prime Video(opens in a new tab).

21. Call Me by Your Name

Credit: Moviestore / Shutterstock

Most of the movie is about Elio (Timothée Chalamet) and Oliver (Armie Hammer) getting together, not splitting apart, but hanging over their entire romance is the poignant knowledge that it can't last forever. Put this one on when you're reflecting back on a brief but passionate affair.

How to watch: Call Me by Your Name is available on iTunes(opens in a new tab) and Prime Video(opens in a new tab).

22. The Break-Up

An exaggerated battle of the sexes between two exes (Vince Vaughn and Jennifer Aniston) gives way to a bittersweet dramedy about damage that can't be undone, even between two people who loved each other once and still might.

23. Birds of Prey

It's not easy striking out alone after an explosive breakup — but Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) serves as a reminder that all things are possible with a can-do attitude, some rad new friends, and a really, really good egg sandwich.

How to watch: Birds of Prey is available on Prime Video(opens in a new tab) and HBO Max(opens in a new tab).

24. The War of the Roses

Oliver (Michael Douglas) and Barbara (Kathleen Turner) duke it out for the house in this acerbically funny divorce comedy, and along the way serve up a cautionary tale about taking that understandable impulse to "win" the breakup way, way, way too far.

How to watch: The War of the Roses is available on iTunes(opens in a new tab) and Prime Video(opens in a new tab).

25. Scott Pilgrim vs. The World

The thing about relationships is that even once they're over, they're still a part of the history you bring to your next romance, for better or for worse. That idea becomes literal for Scott (Michael Cera), who must battle his girlfriend's seven evil exes while dealing with a couple exes of his own.

How to watch: Scott Pilgrim vs. The World is available on iTunes(opens in a new tab) and Prime Video(opens in a new tab).

26. Kill Bill

Kill Bill is for when you're in a post-breakup rage so potent, nothing but (cinematic) violence and bloodshed will do. Vol. 1 is the more action-packed of the two, to help you work out that anger, while Vol. 2 goes deeper into the feels — albeit still with plenty of super cool kills.

How to watch: Kill Bill, Vol. 1 is available on iTunes(opens in a new tab) and Prime Video(opens in a new tab), and Kill Bill, Vol. 2 is available on iTunes(opens in a new tab) and Prime Video(opens in a new tab).

27. Force Majeure

Being single can suck, but being coupled isn't always what it's cracked up to be, either. In Force Majeure, awkward fissures form in a marriage after a man makes a questionable decision in a moment of crisis. (If you hate subtitles, Downhill(opens in a new tab) is the less-good English-language remake.)

How to watch: Force Majeure is available on iTunes(opens in a new tab) and Prime Video(opens in a new tab).

28. The First Wives Club

Perhaps the only thing more gratifying than watching a shitty ex get what's coming to him is watching three shitty exes get what's coming to them, served up with a smirk by the powerhouse trio of Goldie Hawn, Bette Midler, and Diane Keaton.

How to watch: The First Wives Club is available on iTunes(opens in a new tab) and HBO Max.(opens in a new tab)

29. Magic Mike XXL

Magic Mike XXL is only kind of a breakup movie (Mike gets dumped very early in the film), but it does do a great job of celebrating one of the upsides of a breakup: the freedom to join your bros on an epic road trip of sexual pleasure and self-discovery.

How to watch: Magic Mike XXL is available on iTunes(opens in a new tab) and Prime Video(opens in a new tab).

30. Her

Spike Jonze's Her is probably best saved for that post-heartbreak period of self-reflection. Joaquin Phoenix plays an about-to-be-divorced man who starts dating what is essentially a more advanced Siri (Scarlett Johansson), but finds that his new relationship has complications, too.

How to watch: Her is available on iTunes(opens in a new tab) and Prime Video(opens in a new tab).

31. The Breaker Upperers

Need someone to dump your partner so you can avoid a messy confrontation? Call on Jen and Mel (co-writers/co-directors/co-leads Jackie van Beek and Madeleine Sami). For a reasonable fee, these fearless Breaker Upperers will impersonate police officers, play pregnant, or even fake your death to help you ghost an ex. Whatever the shenanigans, van Beek and Sami sparkle. Booming with wild humor and big heart, this New Zealand comedy is guaranteed to leave you cackling. — Kristy Puchko, Film Editor (*)

Because some breakups call for something a bit more dramatic than the usual sobfest. Some breakups come at the end of a relationship so grandly shitty, you need to travel to rural Sweden for a once-in-a-lifetime festival put on by an obscure death cult in order to really get your point across.

6. Waiting to Exhale

7. Celeste and Jesse Forever

It's a sad truth that two people can like each other very much, and still not be meant to love each other. Rashida Jones and Andy Samberg play a pair of high-school sweethearts who remain best friends after seven years of marriage, but feel the need to move on from each other romantically.

8. The Holiday

Remember, the only reason Kate Winslet and Cameron Diaz get to stay in fabulous homes and flirt with Jack Black and Jude Law in this very charming movie is because they previously broke up with two other dudes who totally sucked.

9. The Souvenir

The Souvenir is an exquisite portrait of the doomed relationship between naive Julie (Honor Swinton Byrne) and the mysterious Anthony (Tom Burke), acknowledging both how difficult it can be to disentangle from a toxic relationship, and the bruises it can leave behind.

10. Blue Valentine

Watching Blue Valentine while in the throes of heartbreak is like pressing down on a bruise — the pain is what makes it so satisfying. The film cuts between the tender start of Dean (Ryan Gosling) and Cindy's (Michelle Williams) romance and its jagged end, to tearjerking effect.

11. Casablanca

Few of us get goodbyes to love as epically romantic as the one between Rick (Humphrey Bogart) and Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman). But wouldn't it be nice to imagine we did? They'll always have Paris, and we'll always have Casablanca to weep over when we're at our most tragically brokenhearted.

Gone Girl is about a disappearance, not a breakup — but it does have plenty to say about the hazards of modern marriage. Watch how Nick (Ben Affleck) and Amy (Rosamund Pike) went from meet-cute to fairy-tale courtship to...well, you'll see...and you may decide you're better off single.

14. Crazy, Stupid, Love

15. Appropriate Behavior

Anyone who's tried to remedy a broken heart with petty confrontations and ill-advised hookups will recognize themselves in Shirin (Desiree Akhavan, who also wrote and directed) and her halfhearted attempts to get her life back together after she's dumped by her girlfriend (Rebecca Henderson).

Here's a movie for those dark days when you find yourself wondering if love even exists, or if it's just a cruel joke designed to destroy peoples' lives. Clive Owen, Julia Roberts, Jude Law, and Natalie Portman play four people who can't stop cheating on each other, with bitter results.

Reese Witherspoon's Elle Woods is a role model for anyone smarting over an unappreciative ex. Just do what she does: Work your butt off to win him back, discover exactly how awesome you are in the process, and realize you never needed him in the first place. What, like it's hard?

19. The Wedding Singer

Breakups are never fun, but it can be a consolation to remember that sometimes, they're for the best. Just ask Robbie (Adam Sandler) and Julia (Drew Barrymore), both engaged to the wrong people at the start of The Wedding Singer, and both about to find out that their true loves are each other.

21. Call Me by Your Name

Most of the movie is about Elio (Timothée Chalamet) and Oliver (Armie Hammer) getting together, not splitting apart, but hanging over their entire romance is the poignant knowledge that it can't last forever. Put this one on when you're reflecting back on a brief but passionate affair.

22. The Break-Up

23. Birds of Prey

It's not easy striking out alone after an explosive breakup — but Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) serves as a reminder that all things are possible with a can-do attitude, some rad new friends, and a really, really good egg sandwich.

How to watch: Birds of Prey is available on Prime Video(opens in a new tab) and HBO Max(opens in a new tab).

24. The War of the Roses

Oliver (Michael Douglas) and Barbara (Kathleen Turner) duke it out for the house in this acerbically funny divorce comedy, and along the way serve up a cautionary tale about taking that understandable impulse to "win" the breakup way, way, way too far.

How to watch: The War of the Roses is available on iTunes(opens in a new tab) and Prime Video(opens in a new tab).

25. Scott Pilgrim vs. The World

The thing about relationships is that even once they're over, they're still a part of the history you bring to your next romance, for better or for worse. That idea becomes literal for Scott (Michael Cera), who must battle his girlfriend's seven evil exes while dealing with a couple exes of his own.

Kill Bill is for when you're in a post-breakup rage so potent, nothing but (cinematic) violence and bloodshed will do. Vol. 1 is the more action-packed of the two, to help you work out that anger, while Vol. 2 goes deeper into the feels — albeit still with plenty of super cool kills.

27. Force Majeure

Being single can suck, but being coupled isn't always what it's cracked up to be, either. In Force Majeure, awkward fissures form in a marriage after a man makes a questionable decision in a moment of crisis. (If you hate subtitles, Downhill(opens in a new tab) is the less-good English-language remake.)

28. The First Wives Club

Perhaps the only thing more gratifying than watching a shitty ex get what's coming to him is watching three shitty exes get what's coming to them, served up with a smirk by the powerhouse trio of Goldie Hawn, Bette Midler, and Diane Keaton.

29. Magic Mike XXL

30. Her

Spike Jonze's Her is probably best saved for that post-heartbreak period of self-reflection. Joaquin Phoenix plays an about-to-be-divorced man who starts dating what is essentially a more advanced Siri (Scarlett Johansson), but finds that his new relationship has complications, too.

Quordle is fun, but it can, at times, feel like more trouble than it's worth. Sometimes when your guesses are running low, and the words aren't materializing in your mind, you might think, Why am I doing this? And while I can't answer that, I do have a reminder for you: It's free.

If Quordle is a little too challenging today, you've come to the right place for hints. There aren't just hints here, but the whole Quordle solution. Scroll to the bottom of this page, and there it is. But are you sure you need all four answers? Maybe you just need a strategy guide. Either way, scroll down, and you'll get what you need.

What is Quordle?

Quordle is a five-letter word guessing game similar to Wordle, except each guess applies letters to four words at the same time. You get nine guesses instead of six to correctly guess all four words. It looks like playing four Wordle games at the same time, and that is essentially what it is. But it's not nearly as intimidating as it sounds.

Is Quordle harder than Wordle?

Yes, though not diabolically so.

Where did Quordle come from?

Amid the Wordle boom of late 2021 and early 2022, when everyone was learning to love free, in-browser, once-a-day word guessing games, creator Freddie Meyer says he took inspiration from one of the first big Wordle variations, Dordle — the one where you essentially play two Wordles at once. He took things up a notch, and released Quordle on January 30. Meyer's creation was covered in The Guardian six days later, and now, according to Meyer, it attracts millions of daily users. Today, Meyer earns modest revenue from Patreon, where dedicated Quordle fans can donate to keep their favorite puzzle game running.

How is Quordle pronounced?

“Kwordle.” It should rhyme with “Wordle,” and definitely should not be pronounced exactly like "curdle.”

Is Quordle strategy different from Wordle?

Yes and no.

Your starting strategy should be the same as with Wordle. In fact, if you have a favorite Wordle opening word, there’s no reason to change that here. We suggest something rich in vowels, featuring common letters like C, R, and N. But you do you.

After your first guess, however, you’ll notice things getting out of control if you play Quordle exactly like Wordle.

What should I do in Quordle that I don’t do in Wordle?

Solving a Wordle puzzle can famously come down to a series of single letter-change variations. If you’ve narrowed it down to “-IGHT,” you could guess “MIGHT” “NIGHT” “LIGHT” and “SIGHT” and one of those will probably be the solution — though this is also a famous way to end up losing in Wordle, particularly if you play on “hard mode.” In Quordle, however, this sort of single-letter winnowing is a deadly trap, and it hints at the important strategic difference between Wordle and Quordle: In Quordle, you can't afford to waste guesses unless you're eliminating as many letters as possible at all times.

Guessing a completely random word that you already know isn't the solution, just to eliminate three or four possible letters you haven’t tried yet, is thought of as a desperate, latch-ditch move in Wordle. In Quordle, however, it's a normal part of the player's strategic toolset.

Is there a way to get the answer faster?

In my experience Quordle can be a slow game, sometimes dragging out longer than it would take to play Wordle four times. But a sort of blunt-force guessing approach can speed things up. The following strategy also works with Wordle if you only want the solution, and don’t care about having the fewest possible guesses:

Try starting with a series of words that puts all the vowels (including Y) on the board, along with some other common letters. We've had good luck with the three words: “NOTES,” “ACRID,” and “LUMPY.” YouTuber DougMansLand suggests four words: “CANOE,” “SKIRT,” “PLUMB,” and “FUDGY.”

Most of the alphabet is now eliminated, and you’ll only have the ability to make one or two wrong guesses if you use this strategy. But in most cases you’ll have all the information you need to guess the remaining words without any wrong guesses.

If strategy isn't helping, and you're still stumped, here are some hints:

Are there any double or triple letters in today’s Quordle words?

Two words have letters that occur twice.

Are any rare letters being used in today’s Quordle like Q or Z?

No.

What do today’s Quordle words start with?

S, B, M, and O.

What are the answers for today’s Quordle?

Are you sure you want to know?

There’s still time to turn back.

It's the end of the week, and the beginning of a new Wordle! It's both a trick and a treat to finish your Halloween weekend, but we've got some clues and the solution to help you out, as we do every day.

If you just want today's word, you can jump straight to the end of this article for October 30's Wordle solution, for puzzle #498. If you'd rather work through it yourself, keep reading for some tips, tricks, and clues.

Where did Wordle come from?

Wordle was initially created by engineer Josh Wardle as a gift for his partner, though it quickly spread until it became an international phenomenon. Thousands of players across the globe tackle Wordle each day, with some fans even having created alternate versions of the daily word puzzle game. These include battle royale format Squabble, music identification game Heardle, and variations like Dordle and Quordle that make you guess multiple words at once.

The popularity of Wordle even reached such heights that the New York Times bought it earlier this year, while TikTok creators live-stream themselves playing it.

What's the best Wordle starting word?

The goal of Wordle is to have fun, and there's no right way to have fun. Just choose whatever starting word feels right to you, and don't let anyone shame you for it. However, if you want to take a more strategic approach, we have a few ideas to help you pick a word that will spark joy. One tip is to select a word that includes at least two different vowels, plus some common consonants like S, T, R, or N.

What happened to the Wordle archive?

The entire archive of past Wordles used to be available for anyone to play in glorious days gone by. Unfortunately it has since been taken down, with the website's creator stating it was done at the request of the New York Times.

Is Wordle getting harder?

If you're finding Wordle too easy, you can try enabling its Hard Mode to give your brain a tougher challenge. But Wordle isn't getting any harder by itself — it's the same difficulty that it's always been.

Why are there two different Wordle answers some days?

Wordle is a fun, collective experience specifically because everyone's solving for the same word every day. Occasionally, though, Wordle has accepted two different solutions as correct on the same day. This is because the New York Times made changes to the Wordle word list after acquiring it, and sometimes swaps out words from the original list. To ensure you're getting the right answer every day, refresh your browser before you play — the site will save your streak.

Here's a subtle hint for today's Wordle answer:

Get those dancing shoes on.

Does today's Wordle answer have a double letter?

Nope!

Today's Wordle is a 5-letter word that starts with...

The letter... W.

The Call of Duty game franchise is no stranger to controversy. In fact, controversy is as normal as the gunfights in the series. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II is the latest installment in the series to take real-world geopolitical events and use them to manufacture controversy. Whether it's the player unemotionally gunning down civilians in an airport or the re-framing of an American war crime as Russian, the series has a long history of shocking moments. Modern Warfare II is no different.

Without getting too detailed, the plot of Modern Warfare 2 is a globe-trotting adventure from Mexico to Amsterdam to Chicago that involves chasing terrorists and uncovering a secret plot by a rogue American general and his private military faction.

But instead of the plot, the internet is abuzz over the game's interpretation of recent geopolitics, and many have called out the series for its not-so-subtle — and perhaps superficial — use of real-world headlines for campaign content. And it all harkens back to an interview with gameplay director Jacob Minkoff, around the release of the first in this Modern Warfare series in 2019, in which Minkoff said "I don't think it's a political game."

Is any of this political? Does Call of Duty even believe in anything?

The new Call of Duty starts with an assassination similar to that of Qassem Soleimani

In the opening seconds of the campaign, the player is tasked with visually confirming that Iranian Quds Force General "Ghorbrani" is in attendance for a Russian paramilitary arms deal. The player then takes control of a drone-guided missile that is used to destroy everyone in the vicinity. Just from the name and white beard alone, Twitter was quick to point out the disturbing similarity of the mission to the Trump-authorized assassination of Iranian Quds Force General Qassem Soleimani in 2020.

If you haven't played the game, it may seem like Modern Warfare II would then engage in some introspection about the ethics of the American military playing judge, jury, and executioner in foreign countries. "There's no time for that," the game seemed to say as we were immediately pushed onto the next mission.

The missile strike is the catalyst of the game's plot, which sees the leadership void left by "Ghorbrani's" assassination filled by Major Hassan, the game's main antagonist, who teams with a Mexican cartel to smuggle ballistic missiles into the United States. It's not the first time that Call of Duty has used fictional stand-ins for real-life figures. 2008's Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare's Khaled Al-Asad was a not-so-subtle 1:1 of Saddam Hussein, but unlike the real like man, his in-game doppelganger actually had nuclear weapons (also another point of introspection that doesn't linger long).

Hold right-click to de-escalate civilians

The second major controversy to come from Modern Warfare II happens literally minutes after the assassination of the totally-not-Soleimani Iranian general. In the mission "Borderline," antagonist Major Hassan is being smuggled into the States by the Mexican Cartel with the player assuming the role of Mexican Special Forces rapidly on his trail. The player quite literally jumps over the U.S-Mexico border wall in pursuit of Hassan (illegally, I might add, as the game's CIA Station Operator states).

The problem arises when the player has to sneak through a trailer park and "de-escalate" the civilians whose homes you break into. You do this by pointing a gun at them. Somehow, this actually works, encouraging the civilians to turn around and head in the other direction.

Near the end of the mission, a cop in a cowboy hat profiles the Mexican Special Forces and says "it’s hard to tell you boys apart from the cartel." Are these sequences of events saying maybe something about disproportionate police violence or racial prejudice? Hmmm, maybe, but before I could put on my critical thinking cap and ponder, the cartel blew up the cops, and the gameplay resumed as normal.

It's just a game, why does it matter?

As Mashable's Rebecca Ruiz pointed out, politics is a major source of stress for young people. Regardless of where any given gamer falls on the political spectrum, border security and the killing of a military leader of a country with which the U.S. is not at war are heady, multifaceted topics. While the events in these missions might just be edgy window-dressing for a military shooter, the pattern of driving headlines to market these games is clear. And since you're reading this it obviously worked.

The player then takes control of a drone-guided missile that is used to destroy everyone in the vicinity. Just from the name and white beard alone, Twitter was quick to point out the disturbing similarity of the mission to the Trump-authorized assassination of Iranian Quds Force General Qassem Soleimani in 2020.

If you haven't played the game, it may seem like Modern Warfare II would then engage in some introspection about the ethics of the American military playing judge, jury, and executioner in foreign countries. "There's no time for that," the game seemed to say as we were immediately pushed onto the next mission.

The missile strike is the catalyst of the game's plot, which sees the leadership void left by "Ghorbrani's" assassination filled by Major Hassan, the game's main antagonist, who teams with a Mexican cartel to smuggle ballistic missiles into the United States. It's not the first time that Call of Duty has used fictional stand-ins for real-life figures. 2008's Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare's Khaled Al-Asad was a not-so-subtle 1:1 of Saddam Hussein, but unlike the real like man, his in-game doppelganger actually had nuclear weapons (also another point of introspection that doesn't linger long).

Hold right-click to de-escalate civilians

The second major controversy to come from Modern Warfare II happens literally minutes after the assassination of the totally-not-Soleimani Iranian general. In the mission "Borderline," antagonist Major Hassan is being smuggled into the States by the Mexican Cartel with the player assuming the role of Mexican Special Forces rapidly on his trail. The player quite literally jumps over the U.S-Mexico border wall in pursuit of Hassan (illegally, I might add, as the game's CIA Station Operator states).

The problem arises when the player has to sneak through a trailer park and "de-escalate" the civilians whose homes you break into. You do this by pointing a gun at them. Somehow, this actually works, encouraging the civilians to turn around and head in the other direction.

Near the end of the mission, a cop in a cowboy hat profiles the Mexican Special Forces and says "it’s hard to tell you boys apart from the cartel." Are these sequences of events saying maybe something about disproportionate police violence or racial prejudice? Hmmm, maybe, but before I could put on my critical thinking cap and ponder, the cartel blew up the cops, and the gameplay resumed as normal.

It's just a game, why does it matter?

As Mashable's Rebecca Ruiz pointed out, politics is a major source of stress for young people. Regardless of where any given gamer falls on the political spectrum, border security and the killing of a military leader of a country with which the U.S. is not at war are heady, multifaceted topics. While the events in these missions might just be edgy window-dressing for a military shooter, the pattern of driving headlines to market these games is clear. And since you're reading this it obviously worked.
A long time ago, astronomer Dan Coe discovered a galaxy far, far away… so far, it was considered to be perhaps the most distant in the universe.

Little did he know that what he saw with the Hubble Space Telescope then, MACS0647-JD, might actually be two galaxies instead of one.

Cue a cymbal crash and a John Williams musical score. Crawl, crawl, crawl…

The revelation that Coe's space object might actually be two galaxies merging together is yet another new finding in the James Webb Space Telescope saga, Hubble's infrared successor. In a new blog post from NASA, the European Space Agency, and the Space Telescope Science Institute, Coe describes the difference the new observatory has made: What appeared as a pale red dot 10 years ago — a tiny galaxy a fraction of the size of the Milky Way in the first 400 million years after the big bang — has a little blue companion. Now scientists are discussing what it means.

"If this is the most distant merger, I will be really ecstatic!" said Tiger Yu-Yang Hsiao, an astronomer at Johns Hopkins University, in the NASA blog.

The purpose of the $10 billion Webb telescope is to help scientists understand how the first stars and galaxies formed in the universe, estimated to be 13.8 billion years old. In astronomy, looking farther translates into observing the past because light and other forms of radiation must travel incredible distances to reach us. Light gets stretched into the infrared, which human eyes can't see but Webb's highly sensitive mirrors can detect. Scientists then translate the data into colors.

A phenomenon known as gravitational lensing helped Webb reveal more information about MACS0647-JD. The massive gravity of a cluster of galaxies in the foreground acted as a cosmic lens, bending and magnifying light from the distant system. Not only did this effect make MACS0647-JD more visible, but it scattered copies of the system at different scales in three parts of the image, according to NASA.

Prior to Webb, scientists only knew of a handful of galaxies in the early period of the universe, said Rebecca Larson, an astronomer at the University of Texas in Austin who is part of the research team.

But "Studying them can help us understand how they evolved into the ones like the galaxy we live in today," she said in the blog.

Researchers said the blue gas in the image indicates very young star formation and little dust, while the red is dustier and older. Scientists plan to probe deeper to determine whether these are two galaxies or two clumps of stars within one galaxy.

"This is not a long exposure," Larson said. "We haven’t even really tried to use this telescope to look at one spot for a long time."

It wasn't the average marsquake that the Insight Mars lander heard rip-roaring through the red planet's ground last Christmas Eve.

NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter apparently found the source of the rumble a couple of months later from its vantage point in space: a spectacular meteor strike over 2,000 miles away near Mars' equator, estimated to be one of the largest impacts observed on the neighboring planet.

But what's thrilled scientists perhaps as much as or more than the recorded seismic activity is what the meteor uncovered when it slammed into Mars — huge, boulder-size chunks of ice blasted out of the crater. Up until now, underground ice hadn't been found in this region, the warmest part of the planet.

"This is really an exciting result," said Lori Glaze, NASA's director of planetary science, during a news conference Thursday. "We know, of course, that there's water ice near the poles on Mars. But in planning for future human exploration of Mars, we'd want to land the astronauts as near to the equator as possible, and having access to ice at these lower latitudes, that ice can be converted into water, oxygen, or hydrogen. That could be really useful."

SEE ALSO: NASA just showed us why its Mars lander will soon run out of power

The discovery, recently published in two related studies in the journal Science, is something of a grand finale for NASA's Insight lander, which is losing power rapidly. Scientists have estimated they have about four to eight weeks remaining before they lose contact with the lander. At that point, the mission will end.

For the past four years, Insight has studied upward of 1,000 marsquakes and collected daily weather reports. It has detected the planet's large liquid core and helped map Mars' inner geology.

Program leaders have prepared the public for this outcome for some time. While the spacecraft has sat on the surface of Mars, dust has accumulated on its solar panels. The layers of grit from the red desert planet have blocked out the rays it needs to convert into power. The team has cut back on Insight's operations to squeeze out as much science as possible before the hardware goes kaput.

Then, the team got a bit more bad news last month. A brutal dust storm swept over a large portion of Mar's southern hemisphere. Insight went from having about 400 watt-hours per Martian day to less than 300.

"Unfortunately, since this is such a large dust storm, it's actually put a lot of dust up into the atmosphere, and it has cut down the amount of sunlight reaching the solar panels by quite a bit," said Bruce Banerdt, Insight's principal investigator at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California.

But NASA believes scientists will continue to learn a lot about the past climate conditions on Mars and when and how ice was buried there from the fresh crater, which spans 500 feet wide and just shy of 70 feet deep.

They are confident the ice came from Mars and not the meteor, said Ingrid Daubar, a planetary scientist at Brown University who leads InSight’s impact science working group.

"An impact of this size would actually destroy the meteorite that came in to hit the surface," she said. "We wouldn't expect much, if any, of the original impactor to survive this high energy explosion."

Welcome to Elon Musk's Twitter.

The billionaire's bid to purchase the social platform actually, finally, really went through after a long, dramatic saga. So, uh, what now? Honestly who knows, but Musk has promised to potentially fire a bunch of people and to basically do customer support for a right-wing troll. Not exactly normal times for Twitter.

For now, we've collected the absolute best and funniest tweets of the week, like we always do. Because who knows what the future holds.

1. This is a beautiful sight to behold out in the world.

2. The thing is that this is a correct observation, despite when it was made.

3. Sometimes you must go vibe in the bathroom. That is OK. In fact, it is good.

4. Beans. Beans!

5. Morning people need to be controlled and watched, not empowered.

6. If I were a bird, then I would not be in the state of Ohio for a significant period of time. Simple as that.

7. You pay with your soul ever single time you log on to Twitter. It takes little soul micro-transactions to log on. Everyone knows that.

8. An obligatory dril tweet.

9. Just a good lit joke for you.

10. And finally, this tweet.

Remember when you were in grade school and found out you had a new teacher? Imagine Twitter as that class, and Elon Musk as the teacher now that a whole bunch of Twitter users are testing the boundaries of what's allowed on the app under the tutelage of someone new.

Researchers have seen a spike in hateful language on the platform in just the last 24 hours since Musks's takeover, a direct result of users testing the limits of Musk's promise of a free speech platform. Given that Musk has already done away with top executives who guided moderation strategy and won't make any decisions on the matter until convening his own council, it's unlikely that he'll be coming down on that kind of language any time soon.

In the meantime, we've gathered a few quick tips for controlling your Twitter experience and steering clear of hateful language and ideas.

If someone is harassing you

Need help ASAP? If someone is targeting you, block-followers.glitch.me will automatically block that account's followers to prevent pile-ons. If you're targeted by a particularly hurtful or hateful tweet, Block Party allows you to block anyone who likes or retweets it.

Once that's done, report the account that is harassing you. It is unclear what content moderation infrastructure will remain in place as Musk takes over, but it is always worth a try. Twitter's reporting process provides a field for explaining why a reported tweet is harmful. Use that to state your case to content moderators and move the process along more quickly.

To block or silence unwanted noise

A block chain is one of the simplest ways to control your Twitter experience, but it's also the least discerning. When you initiate a block chain for a specific account, you block every person following that account. That means you're blocking hundreds, even thousands, of people at one time, which is something to keep in mind.

One of the most popular block chain extensions is Twitter Block Chain, though users say Korean app Red Block is faster and more effective. Red Block is only available in Korean, but you can read an English-level explanation of how to use it by clicking this link.

You can also use a third party app like Block Party to filter your Twitter mentions so you only see tweets from the people you choose to hear from. For example, you can limit the tweets you see to those from people you follow and from verified accounts. You can also block all accounts without a profile picture or with less than 100 followers, which does a lot to weed out shitposting trolls.

Can't remember why you blocked someone? Block Party lets you add a note, so you'll never forget why they shouldn't be allowed back into your digital life.

Cut down on badly behaving accounts and bots

Extensions like BotSentinel use machine learning and AI to classify and track Twitter accounts that they deems inauthentic or run by trolls, then adds the accounts to a public database.

To check if an individual account is a bot, see what Botometer thinks. Or you can use an extension like BotSight, which gives Twitter accounts in your feed a "bot-probability score" so you can tell when a tweet may not have come from a real person.

Keep in mind that reviews for these extensions note they're not perfect and can sometimes mislabel tweets and accounts, so false positives are likely.

Use built-in safety and privacy tools

Third party apps and extensions step in to level up your privacy and security, but Twitter also offers useful moderation tools that go beyond blocking and reporting content. Try muting words, topics, or conversations to stop seeing tweets or notifications you’d rather avoid.

You can also limit replies to your tweets, so that only people you follow or mention can engage with them. Consider putting your account on private, even for just a few hours, or using your Twitter Circle to express yourself to a trusted audience.

Finally, don't forget to step away and take a break from the internet to gain fresh air and perspective. Nature doesn't care about how many followers you have, and is always ready to welcome you back.

Wendell and Wild drops us into a handcrafted world of demonic fun fairs, austere religious academies, and snowy graveyards where the dead wait for resurrection. Bringing it all to life is director Henry Selick, whose films like The Nightmare Before Christmas and Coraline have cemented him as a legend in the world of stop-motion animation.

Wendell and Wild marks Selick's first feature film in 13 years, and what a return it proves to be. From the surreal Scream Fair held on the belly of a massive demon to main character Kat's (voiced by Lyric Ross) Afro-punk outfits, each element of Wendell and Wild is packed with an astounding amount of care and detail. Every second of the movie is proof of the power of stop motion: You truly see the human effort that went into telling this story.

That emphasis on the work of the animators was extra important to Selick coming into Wendell and Wild. "Since Coraline till now, which is 13 years, I think a lot of stop motion has gotten a little too perfect, too CG-like," Selick told Mashable in a video interview. "Me and the animation supervisors for this — Jeff Riley and Malcolm Lamont — we wanted to pull it back to feel more handmade, to make it very clear that this was touched by human hands directly, and didn't go through all these other steps. The animators literally shaped these characters a frame at a time and breathe a performance into them."

The bespoke quality of this technique presents itself in different ways throughout Wendell and Wild. The attractions at the Scream Fair and the damned souls who ride them look as if they've been cut from paper, and several flashback sequences evoke shadow puppetry. Many characters — especially demons Wendell (voiced by Keegan-Michael Key) and Wild (voiced by Jordan Peele) — look like drawings come to life thanks to their exaggerated features.

Perhaps most noticeable are the seams along characters' faces, which are crucial to the animation process. Selick and his team use a technique called "replacement animation," where you make multiple versions of part of a puppet, say an arm or a leg. To capture different actions, you replace parts of the puppet with these various iterations. For The Nightmare Before Christmas, animators replaced Jack Skellington's entire head for different expressions. In Coraline, faces were split in half.

"We figured if we split the face into upper and lower halves, then we can have different combinations of brows and squinted eyes with different mouths, and we'd have a lot more variety," said Selick.

Splitting the characters' faces meant that seams were involved in Coraline, too. Selick fought to include them, but "the studio, Laika, was too freaked out about showing them," he said. Now, though, in Wendell and Wild, the face seams are on full display as proof of Selick, Riley, and Lamont's desire to return to the hand-hewn.

What some might call imperfections, Selick calls charm. "Whenever there was a mistake [in the movie], I'd be asked, 'Well, is this charm or a mistake?' If it was a really big mistake, then it's a mistake, and we would fix it," Selick explained. "But most of the time it was stop-motion charm. And you know, I think it's a real thing."

For example, the head demon Buffalo Belzer (voiced by Ving Rhames) doesn't have as wide a range of facial expressions as characters like Kat. As Selick describes it, "His face pops from expression to expression, and not very smoothly. It's not so much a mistake as we limited his range a lot, and yet, I think it still works for his character."

These moments of charm populate Wendell and Wild with the humanity and proof of artistry that Selick wanted, and that even shines through in the film's credits and post-credit scene. As the credits roll, we see footage of the creation of the film's massive puppets and set pieces, serving as an ode both to the team who brought Wendell and Wild to life and to the art of stop motion in general. Brimming with hand-crafted artistry and, yes, plenty of charm, Wendell and Wild is a treat for any animation aficionado.

Season 2 of Mike White's The White Lotus swaps Hawaii for Sicily, brings in an (almost) entirely new cast of resort guests and employees, remixes its iconic theme song, and lets loose yet another tidal wave of chaos. However, despite the makeover, The White Lotus Season 2 feels very much like its predecessor — for better and for worse.

Fresh off her Emmy win, Jennifer Coolidge returns as the wealthy Tanya McQuoid, along with Jon Gries as her husband Greg. Their marriage is anything but paradise: Tanya is still deeply unhappy, and she worries that Greg isn't telling her something. Coolidge is brilliant as always, although early episodes of the season (I have seen the first five) give her less to do. Things pick up for her after she meets a group of gay men who are utterly obsessed with her, leading to some of the season's funniest and most poignant conversations.

Accompanying Tanya is her twenty-something assistant Portia (Haley Lu Richardson), who is desperately seeking a career change. Yes, she's at a five-star resort in Sicily, but she still feels unfulfilled and without purpose. She hits it off with Albie (Adam DiMarco), another guest who's in Sicily with his grandfather Bert (F. Murray Abraham) and his womanizing father Dominic (Michael Imperioli).

With a wife and daughter who hate him due to his behavior, Dominic is our major introduction to the season's main themes of fidelity and sex — themes that will quickly consume every character. He makes contact with local sex worker Lucia (Simona Tabasco), who brings her friend Mia (Beatrice Grannò) along with her to the White Lotus. The intrusion of the locals aggravates hotel manager Valentina, played by the hilariously no-nonsense Sabrina Impacciatore, who I truly wish we got to see more of.

That's already a ton of characters to keep track of, and I haven't even gotten to the core four. The centerpiece of The White Lotus Season 2 is undoubtedly a pair of married couples played by Aubrey Plaza, Will Sharpe, Meghann Fahy, and Theo James. Cameron (James) and Daphne (Fahy) have invited Harper (Plaza) and Ethan (Sharpe) on vacation. Cameron and Ethan were college roommates, and now that Ethan has sold his company, Harper is convinced Cameron is trying to get Ethan to invest in him. Harper in particular is disdainful of Cameron and Daphne's extreme wealth and unwillingness to engage in the world around them — they don't vote or read the news.

All four actors play the uncomfortable power dynamics within the group to perfection. James gets to go full jerk mode, making for a great foil to Sharpe's more passive Ethan. The entire season seems to be building up to Ethan's breaking point in the face of Cameron's gross misconduct, but when (and how) it will occur remains an exciting mystery. Then there's Fahy, so brilliant as a character who appears to be a vapid housewife until we truly get to know her. Fahy peels back the layers of Daphne and her relationship with Cameron bit by bit until we realize that she is full of surprises — some quite funny, others absolutely heartbreaking. Rounding out the quartet is Plaza, whose acerbic delivery and understated comedic timing remain unmatched. Watching the tensions between these four come to light is a delicious treat in a season that can at times feel overstuffed. Other plots are engaging, but every time White cuts away from these four, you'll wish you could spend a little more time with them.

An undeniably horny season

While sex definitely figured into The White Lotus Season 1, it shoots to the forefront in Season 2. Luckily for us, this iteration of the show is at its best and by far most interesting when it's examining its characters' relationships to sex and to their partners. It's also where The White Lotus embraces its messiness, which is perfect if you want the chaos of a reality show like Love is Blind paired with gorgeous cinematography and the sheen of prestige TV.

The White Lotus's portrayal of sex and relationships ranges from the awkward first interactions between Albie and Portia, to the sad disconnect between Tanya and Greg, to the absolutely gut-churning...whatever is happening with Harper, Ethan, Daphne, and Cameron. In the show's first episode, Cameron strips down near Harper in a violating power play, which Ethan later dismisses as a total accident. And that's not even close to how unhinged this season gets.

The guests of the White Lotus can't escape questions of sex and monogamy, and neither can the viewers. The new opening credits sequence is chock full of sexually charged and occasionally violent murals. A major recurring motif throughout the season is the appearance of Sicilian ceramic heads, a staple of art around the island that comes from a legend of a jilted woman cutting off her lover's head. Like with much of the rest of the show, White lays this symbolism on a bit thick. How many times do we have to see shots of these heads underscored by foreboding music?

The White Lotus Season 2 occasionally succumbs to Season 1's pitfalls

This latest installment of The White Lotus is full of the kinds of jaw-droppingly uncomfortable conversations that made Season 1 must-watch TV, yet it also retreads story moments we've seen before, which dulls some of its surprise. As per what is becoming The White Lotus's formula, the season opens with the death of some unknown character and then flashes back to a week prior. Only this time, in a deviation from the formula, multiple people are dead! Later, Valentina also gets stuck with what feels like watered-down elements of Armond's Season 1 storyline. At a certain point, a bag full of drugs becomes a major plot device — where have we seen that before?

Like with Season 1, Season 2's satire is at times far too on the nose. "We're saying something important!" The White Lotus crows at seemingly every opportunity. However, it is so focused on the mere fact that it's addressing class and privilege that it rarely takes a chance to dive deeper. Remarking that wealth makes people behave differently — most often badly — is not nearly as revelatory as the show seems to think it is.

The White Lotus's shortcomings as a concept are certainly on display this season, but the performances and the outrageous plot twists are so compulsively watchable it's impossible not to keep tuning back in. Like the ideal holiday, it's enjoyable, frothy, and seductive... although unlike said holiday, there are times when you wish The White Lotus was a little less over the top.

Season 2 of Mike White's The White Lotus swaps Hawaii for Sicily, brings in an (almost) entirely new cast of resort guests and employees, remixes its iconic theme song, and lets loose yet another tidal wave of chaos. However, despite the makeover, The White Lotus Season 2 feels very much like its predecessor — for better and for worse.

Even the toughest microbe couldn't survive for long on Mars' tortured desert ground.

Deadly radiation from the cosmos pummels the surface. The temperature averages minus 80 degrees Fahrenheit. In the profoundly dry, sparse atmosphere, a cup of water would immediately vaporize.

Yet beneath the hellish ground, hardy microbes — if they ever existed — could have endured for millions of years. And by eluding the threats from above, this life may even have survived until today. "There's no escape unless you're deeply buried under the surface," Michael Daly, a professor of pathology at Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, a university run by the federal government, told Mashable.

Daly and a team of scientists recently published new research in the space journal Astrobiology showing that an incredibly robust earthly microbe, Deinococcus radiodurans — which survives in nuclear reactors — could endure for millions of years if buried underground. The farther down, the more protection. By exposing the bacteria to intensive radiation in a laboratory, the scientists concluded D. radiodurans could weather radiation for 1.5 million years at some four inches down. But at around 30 feet, the buried microbe could endure, in a dormant state, for 280 million years. "That's a shocking amount of time," Daly noted.

You read that right: 280 million years. To prove the tiny organism could withstand such hostile radiation environs, they showed it no mercy. "The cells were exposed to truly astronomical doses of radiation," Daly emphasized. He noted that when dried and frozen in simulated subsurface Mars-like conditions, D. radiodurans tolerated 140,000 grays of radiation (a "gray" is a unit of radiation that something, or somebody, absorbs). That's 28,000 times the amount of radiation that would kill a person.

Indeed, the barren Martian surface looks lifeless today. But if an extremely radiation-resistant microbe like D. radiodurans could evolve on Earth, something similar could potentially do the same on Mars, a planet once habitable, and flush with water.

"It's so important for us to recognize that life is so tenacious."

What's more, microbial life on Earth thrives in uninviting underground realms. "We know life on Earth lives kilometers down in bedrock," Amy Williams, an astrobiologist at the University of Florida who was not involved in the new research, told Mashable.

"It's so important for us to recognize that life is so tenacious," Williams, who works on NASA's Mars Perseverance and Curiosity rover missions, added. "We could be meters away from discovering our closest planetary neighbors."

How Martian life might find a way

For good reason, the microbe D. radiodurans is dubbed "Conan the Bacterium."

When exposed to a powerful, damaging type of radiation that can change and damage tissue — called "ionizing radiation" — this microbe can (amazingly) repair broken apart genetic material. These bacteria also produce chemicals that protect them from radiation. And you needn't look far to find them. They're everywhere. They're in the soil. "They're found in our stomach and gastrointestinal tract," noted Daly.

Researchers already knew D. radiodurans could likely survive for some 1.2 million years just below the Martian ground. But no one had ever tested D. radiodurans in truly underground Martian-like conditions, where the hardy organism would be buried in a freezing and immensely dry place. Until now. The researchers completely dried out the microbes in "desiccation chambers." Then they zapped the frozen and dry D. radiodurans with intense radiation for days.

"We have shattered all previous records of ionizing radiation resistance," Daly said.

"There's no escape unless you're deeply buried in the surface."

So while a microbe like D. radiodurans might only last a few hours on the irradiated Martian surface, underground it may last for ages, until the radiation eventually takes its toll.

"It's compelling in that it gives us context for how life could have survived on Mars, if it ever arose," said Williams.

Enduring for hundreds of millions of years, however, means surviving as a frozen spore or microbe. And perhaps, at times, the microbes could reanimate when conditions changed or a thaw occurs. On Earth, for example, NASA scientists successfully thawed ice age bacteria that had been frozen for some 32,000 years. The frozen life revived.

How might a Martian bacteria thaw and reanimate? Mars is constantly pelted with big space rocks. They don't burn up in the thin Martian surface, so they pummel the ground and make new craters. There are countless places where the bombarded surface has heated from tremendous impacts. Ice, which is plentiful in parts of Mars' subsurface, could melt, too. This all creates an inviting environment, though temporary, for microbes to once again repopulate and spread, Daly said. The organisms would likely freeze again, and lurk in dormancy.

A future robotic mission could probe the Martian subsurface for this potential, frozen life. The European Space Agency's much-anticipated Rosalind Franklin rover — which may not launch until 2028 — will drill a couple meters below the surface in search for hints of Martian life, whether past, or possibly even present. "The ESA-led Rosalind Franklin rover has a unique potential to search for evidence of past life on Mars thanks to its drill and laboratory," the ESA writes. "It will be the first rover to drill 2 m below the surface, and the first to use novel driving techniques, including wheel-walking, to overcome obstacles."

Such a mission is a major, if not thrilling, leap in the effort to seek otherworldly life. "You're potentially looking for an ecosystem that still exists," noted Williams. "If you pulled up some of these cells, you could potentially detect them."

(Crucially, some missions to Mars, like NASA's Mars Sample Return Program, will blast rocky Martian samples back to Earth. This new research underscores that we should be wary: If not careful, we could contaminate Earth with hardy Martian microbes.)

Still today, there remains zero evidence that living organisms exist anywhere beyond Earth — though there are certainly enticing worlds in our very solar system that could harbor life. We're scouring the Martian surface for even hints of life, though it's unknown if we'll ever find compelling evidence. But microbes on Earth thrive in extreme places. In lightless places. In torrid hot springs. In acid. In toxic waste. Why not under the Martian ground?

"Microbes are incredibly resilient," said Williams. "They will find a way, if it's possible."

There's plenty of British TV on Hulu, but what's the best?

Sure, you could enjoy Colin Firth striding gallantly out of a pond in Pride and Prejudice(opens in a new tab) again — it's a classic. Yes, Coronation Street(opens in a new tab) and Hollyoaks(opens in a new tab) are always there if you need them. But what about something a little more fresh, emblematic of all the incredible shows that are coming out of the UK?

We've gone through Hulu's British TV shows to find the best series you should really add to your list. From the heart-wrenching twists and twirls of Normal People to everyone's favorite cat-and-mouse game Killing Eve, these UK-produced shows are long-loved classics, provocative hidden gems, and newer showstoppers that everyone can't stop talking about (in no particular order).

1. Killing Eve

Villainelle could be anywhere, Eve! Credit: BBC

The ultimate game of cat and mouse, Killing Eve is a truly addictive thriller that will have you wanting to run about town in a fluffy pink tulle dress but hopefully not doing crimes in it. Created by Fleabag queen Phoebe Waller-Bridge, the series centres around meticulous MI5 agent Eve (Sandra Oh) and intense assassin Villanelle (Jodie Comer) who find themselves relentlessly drawn toward one another. We're on three seasons so far, each spinning a tangled web and keeping you on your toes with the actors' incredible performances and Waller-Bridge's signature sharp writing. — Shannon Connellan, UK Editor

2. The Office (U.K.)

The OG phenomenon behind the sitcom we’ve all come to quote in our sleep , The Office (U.K.) set the precedent for Michael Scott and co. way back in 2001. Much like its American remake , The Office (U.K.) is set in the dreary town of Slough, at a paper company run by David Brent (Ricky Gervais), a horrendously awkward business man who thinks he's supremely cool, funny, and successful. David Brent is, of course, the British template for Michael Scott (Steve Carell), which means his endless social faux pas lead to hilarious hijinks doused in wry humor. Keep an eye out for all the British counterparts of our beloved characters — Dwight, Jim, Pam, and Roy are all very much there. — Yasmeen Hamadeh, Entertainment Intern

3. Luther

If you haven't joined DCI John Luther for a murder investigation, you should really get on it. Idris Elba stars in the titular role of this psychological crime thriller series, one that sees an overly dedicated detective chasing twisted criminals (sometimes too close to home) across London. An unsettlingly villainous Ruth Wilson and intense Indira Varma are highlights of the early days of the dark crime series, which was created by Neil Cross. The twists and turns of Luther are genuine pivots, so hold onto your butts. — S.C.

4. Normal People

Yes, it's Irish, but it was produced by BBC Three so we're counting it in here (any excuse). Based on Sally Rooney's novel, the BBC/Hulu's tear-jerking adaptation of Normal People seemed to capture everybody's hearts when it aired in spring 2020, and with good reason. Telling the years-long story of the romance between two troubled Irish teenagers, Marianne (Daisy Edgar-Jones) and Connell (Paul Mescal), the show merges beautiful writing and cinematography with gut-wrenching performances.

"Before watching, know this: there will be feelings, and plenty of them," wrote Mashable's Rachel Thompson in her review. "You might cry (I certainly did). You might see your own experience in amongst the drama. You might remember past loves, past heartbreaks. You might, for a brief moment, remember what life and love was like before COVID-19. And for that, you will feel thankful, young again, alive, and no longer numb."— Sam Haysom, Deputy UK Editor

5. This Way Up

A Strong Mood. Credit: Channel 4

Created by and starring Aisling Bea, whipsmart, hilarious, and poignant Channel 4 series This Way Up is a song for the lonely, as Cher would put it. Bea stars as Aine, a London teacher who's really going through it, while Sharon Horgan stars as her sister Shona, who has her back through any and all storms. Season 1 is "one of the few accurate portrayals of millennial loneliness that truly distills the reality of what it's like to be lonely in a city packed with people," while Season 2 "captures mental health issues and sisterly relationships with compassion." — S.C.

6. Love Island

"I've got a text!" If these words mean nothing to you, then chances are you're missing out, hun. Love Island season marks the beginning of the horniest time of year in Britain, when the words "Can I pull you for a chat?" promise a world of opportunity for bevs, NVQs, and getting pied. ITV's Love Island sees 11 islanders share a villa in Mallorca, Spain, where, upon arrival, they couple up with someone they fancy, and promptly have to share a bed with them until the producers announce a recoupling. As islanders get to know one another, loyalties change, and curveballs are thrown in when "bombshells" show up at the villa to make contestants question who they really want to be with — the person in their bed, or the new person standing before them? Will their decision lead to someone getting dumped from the island? Choices are made, some of them good, some terrible — but you'll likely be unable to tear yourself away from the messy drama of it all. It is what it is, babes. — Rachel Thompson, Senior Culture Reporter

Sweetie, darling, if you haven’t watched Absolutely Fabulous, grab a bottle of Bolly or Stoli or both, and let's get bloody going, shall we? Jennifer Saunders and Joanna Lumley are simply everything as the iconic Edina and Patsy, Eddy and Pats, inseparable friends creating chaos in the high-flying London fashion world, spectacularly tumbling out of cabs and generally recovering face down on Eddy's kitchen table. Offsetting the pair's hilarious, booze-fuelled pandemonium is Edina's long-suffering, haughty daughter Saffron (Julia Sawalha), her mischievous mother (June Whitfield), and her well-meaning but fairly useless assistant Bubble (Jane Horrocks). — S.C.

Harlots on Hulu is about two warring brothels in Georgian-era London, each run by a formidable woman who straight up wants to murder the other. The first is Margaret Wells, whose working-class institution services men from all walks of life. Her nemesis is Lydia Quigley, a puffed up and powdered pseudo-lady whose pastel-toned mansion is a playground for blue-bloods and their ilk.

Their beef is as old as Margaret herself, and the murder-filled, underhanded plots they hatch to take each other down makes the show less of a sex-filled period drama and more of a tale of two madam mobsters. — Alexis Nedd, Senior Entertainment Reporter (*)

Unlike fellow show about sixth form students The Inbetweeners, Skins isn't just an out-and-out comedy — it also contains a fair bit of drama and darkness. One of the interesting things about Skins is its structure; every two seasons we get a new group of characters, following them on their two-year journey through college in the city of Bristol, and injecting the show with a batch of fresh faces. The same issues and themes crop up throughout, though, with the show refusing to shy away from topics like bereavement, mental illness and suicide. Does it get slightly far-fetched every now and then? Yes. But at its best (as it is in the first two seasons), it's an engaging and poignant study of complex characters navigating a difficult chapter in life. – S.H.

10. Line of Duty

Jesus, Mary, and Joseph, and the wee donkey, Line of Duty was all anyone could talk about this year in the UK. When the sixth season of the beloved police corruption drama landed on BBC in March, Twitter exploded over the awaited "bent coppers" line delivered by Adrian Dunbar as one Superintendent Ted Hastings.

Although the final episode polarised fans, Season 6 of Line of Duty was undeniably one of the shows that had people glued to their sets during yet another lockdown in the UK (but as it does every season, really). There are excellent performances across the seasons too from some of Britain's best actors, including Thandiwe Newton as DCI Roseanne Huntley, Keeley Hawes as DI Lindsay Denton, Lennie James as DCI Tony Gates, and Kelly Macdonald as DCI Joanne Davidson. — S.C.

There's plenty of British TV on Hulu, but what's the best?

Sure, you could enjoy Colin Firth striding gallantly out of a pond in Pride and Prejudice(opens in a new tab) again — it's a classic. Yes, Coronation Street(opens in a new tab) and Hollyoaks(opens in a new tab) are always there if you need them. But what about something a little more fresh, emblematic of all the incredible shows that are coming out of the UK?

We've gone through Hulu's British TV shows to find the best series you should really add to your list. From the heart-wrenching twists and twirls of Normal People to everyone's favorite cat-and-mouse game Killing Eve, these UK-produced shows are long-loved classics, provocative hidden gems, and newer showstoppers that everyone can't stop talking about (in no particular order).

1. Killing Eve

Villainelle could be anywhere, Eve! Credit: BBC

The ultimate game of cat and mouse, Killing Eve is a truly addictive thriller that will have you wanting to run about town in a fluffy pink tulle dress but hopefully not doing crimes in it. Created by Fleabag queen Phoebe Waller-Bridge, the series centres around meticulous MI5 agent Eve (Sandra Oh) and intense assassin Villanelle (Jodie Comer) who find themselves relentlessly drawn toward one another. We're on three seasons so far, each spinning a tangled web and keeping you on your toes with the actors' incredible performances and Waller-Bridge's signature sharp writing. — Shannon Connellan, UK Editor

The OG phenomenon behind the sitcom we’ve all come to quote in our sleep , The Office (U.K.) set the precedent for Michael Scott and co. way back in 2001. Much like its American remake , The Office (U.K.) is set in the dreary town of Slough, at a paper company run by David Brent (Ricky Gervais), a horrendously awkward business man who thinks he's supremely cool, funny, and successful. David Brent is, of course, the British template for Michael Scott (Steve Carell), which means his endless social faux pas lead to hilarious hijinks doused in wry humor. Keep an eye out for all the British counterparts of our beloved characters — Dwight, Jim, Pam, and Roy are all very much there. — Yasmeen Hamadeh, Entertainment Intern

3. Luther

If you haven't joined DCI John Luther for a murder investigation, you should really get on it. Idris Elba stars in the titular role of this psychological crime thriller series, one that sees an overly dedicated detective chasing twisted criminals (sometimes too close to home) across London. An unsettlingly villainous Ruth Wilson and intense Indira Varma are highlights of the early days of the dark crime series, which was created by Neil Cross. The twists and turns of Luther are genuine pivots, so hold onto your butts. — S.C.

Yes, it's Irish, but it was produced by BBC Three so we're counting it in here (any excuse). Based on Sally Rooney's novel, the BBC/Hulu's tear-jerking adaptation of Normal People seemed to capture everybody's hearts when it aired in spring 2020, and with good reason. Telling the years-long story of the romance between two troubled Irish teenagers, Marianne (Daisy Edgar-Jones) and Connell (Paul Mescal), the show merges beautiful writing and cinematography with gut-wrenching performances.

"Before watching, know this: there will be feelings, and plenty of them," wrote Mashable's Rachel Thompson in her review. "You might cry (I certainly did). You might see your own experience in amongst the drama. You might remember past loves, past heartbreaks. You might, for a brief moment, remember what life and love was like before COVID-19. And for that, you will feel thankful, young again, alive, and no longer numb."— Sam Haysom, Deputy UK Editor

5. This Way Up

Created by and starring Aisling Bea, whipsmart, hilarious, and poignant Channel 4 series This Way Up is a song for the lonely, as Cher would put it. Bea stars as Aine, a London teacher who's really going through it, while Sharon Horgan stars as her sister Shona, who has her back through any and all storms. Season 1 is "one of the few accurate portrayals of millennial loneliness that truly distills the reality of what it's like to be lonely in a city packed with people," while Season 2 "captures mental health issues and sisterly relationships with compassion." — S.C.

6. Love Island

"I've got a text!" If these words mean nothing to you, then chances are you're missing out, hun. Love Island season marks the beginning of the horniest time of year in Britain, when the words "Can I pull you for a chat?" promise a world of opportunity for bevs, NVQs, and getting pied. ITV's Love Island sees 11 islanders share a villa in Mallorca, Spain, where, upon arrival, they couple up with someone they fancy, and promptly have to share a bed with them until the producers announce a recoupling. As islanders get to know one another, loyalties change, and curveballs are thrown in when "bombshells" show up at the villa to make contestants question who they really want to be with — the person in their bed, or the new person standing before them? Will their decision lead to someone getting dumped from the island? Choices are made, some of them good, some terrible — but you'll likely be unable to tear yourself away from the messy drama of it all. It is what it is, babes. — Rachel Thompson, Senior Culture Reporter

Sweetie, darling, if you haven’t watched Absolutely Fabulous, grab a bottle of Bolly or Stoli or both, and let's get bloody going, shall we? Jennifer Saunders and Joanna Lumley are simply everything as the iconic Edina and Patsy, Eddy and Pats, inseparable friends creating chaos in the high-flying London fashion world, spectacularly tumbling out of cabs and generally recovering face down on Eddy's kitchen table. Offsetting the pair's hilarious, booze-fuelled pandemonium is Edina's long-suffering, haughty daughter Saffron (Julia Sawalha), her mischievous mother (June Whitfield), and her well-meaning but fairly useless assistant Bubble (Jane Horrocks). — S.C.

Harlots on Hulu is about two warring brothels in Georgian-era London, each run by a formidable woman who straight up wants to murder the other. The first is Margaret Wells, whose working-class institution services men from all walks of life. Her nemesis is Lydia Quigley, a puffed up and powdered pseudo-lady whose pastel-toned mansion is a playground for blue-bloods and their ilk.

Their beef is as old as Margaret herself, and the murder-filled, underhanded plots they hatch to take each other down makes the show less of a sex-filled period drama and more of a tale of two madam mobsters. — Alexis Nedd, Senior Entertainment Reporter (*)

Let's not pretend every Quordle is equally hard. Some only take a few seconds, and some will drive you crazy. But they all do have something in common: Once you start them you won't be satisfied until you finish them.

If Quordle is a little too challenging today, you've come to the right place for hints. There aren't just hints here, but the whole Quordle solution. Scroll to the bottom of this page, and there it is. But are you sure you need all four answers? Maybe you just need a strategy guide. Either way, scroll down, and you'll get what you need.

What is Quordle?

Quordle is a five-letter word guessing game similar to Wordle, except each guess applies letters to four words at the same time. You get nine guesses instead of six to correctly guess all four words. It looks like playing four Wordle games at the same time, and that is essentially what it is. But it's not nearly as intimidating as it sounds.

Is Quordle harder than Wordle?

Yes, though not diabolically so.

Where did Quordle come from?

Amid the Wordle boom of late 2021 and early 2022, when everyone was learning to love free, in-browser, once-a-day word guessing games, creator Freddie Meyer says he took inspiration from one of the first big Wordle variations, Dordle — the one where you essentially play two Wordles at once. He took things up a notch, and released Quordle on January 30. Meyer's creation was covered in The Guardian six days later, and now, according to Meyer, it attracts millions of daily users. Today, Meyer earns modest revenue from Patreon, where dedicated Quordle fans can donate to keep their favorite puzzle game running.

How is Quordle pronounced?

“Kwordle.” It should rhyme with “Wordle,” and definitely should not be pronounced exactly like "curdle.”

Is Quordle strategy different from Wordle?

Yes and no.

Your starting strategy should be the same as with Wordle. In fact, if you have a favorite Wordle opening word, there’s no reason to change that here. We suggest something rich in vowels, featuring common letters like C, R, and N. But you do you.

After your first guess, however, you’ll notice things getting out of control if you play Quordle exactly like Wordle.

What should I do in Quordle that I don’t do in Wordle?

Solving a Wordle puzzle can famously come down to a series of single letter-change variations. If you’ve narrowed it down to “-IGHT,” you could guess “MIGHT” “NIGHT” “LIGHT” and “SIGHT” and one of those will probably be the solution — though this is also a famous way to end up losing in Wordle, particularly if you play on “hard mode.” In Quordle, however, this sort of single-letter winnowing is a deadly trap, and it hints at the important strategic difference between Wordle and Quordle: In Quordle, you can't afford to waste guesses unless you're eliminating as many letters as possible at all times.

Guessing a completely random word that you already know isn't the solution, just to eliminate three or four possible letters you haven’t tried yet, is thought of as a desperate, latch-ditch move in Wordle. In Quordle, however, it's a normal part of the player's strategic toolset.

Is there a way to get the answer faster?

In my experience Quordle can be a slow game, sometimes dragging out longer than it would take to play Wordle four times. But a sort of blunt-force guessing approach can speed things up. The following strategy also works with Wordle if you only want the solution, and don’t care about having the fewest possible guesses:

Try starting with a series of words that puts all the vowels (including Y) on the board, along with some other common letters. We've had good luck with the three words: “NOTES,” “ACRID,” and “LUMPY.” YouTuber DougMansLand suggests four words: “CANOE,” “SKIRT,” “PLUMB,” and “FUDGY.”

Most of the alphabet is now eliminated, and you’ll only have the ability to make one or two wrong guesses if you use this strategy. But in most cases you’ll have all the information you need to guess the remaining words without any wrong guesses.

If strategy isn't helping, and you're still stumped, here are some hints:

Are there any double or triple letters in today’s Quordle words?

One word has a letter that occurs twice.

Are any rare letters being used in today’s Quordle like Q or Z?

No.

What do today’s Quordle words start with?

C, T, S, and A.

What are the answers for today’s Quordle?

Are you sure you want to know?

There’s still time to turn back.

OK, you asked for it. The answers are:

It's the end of the week, and the beginning of a new Wordle! It's both a trick and a treat to kick off your Halloween weekend, but we've got some clues and the solution to help you out, as we do every day.

If you just want today's word, you can jump straight to the end of this article for October 29's Wordle solution, for puzzle #497. If you'd rather work through it yourself, keep reading for some tips, tricks, and clues.

Where did Wordle come from?

Wordle was initially created by engineer Josh Wardle as a gift for his partner, though it quickly spread until it became an international phenomenon. Thousands of players across the globe tackle Wordle each day, with some fans even having created alternate versions of the daily word puzzle game. These include battle royale format Squabble, music identification game Heardle, and variations like Dordle and Quordle that make you guess multiple words at once.

The popularity of Wordle even reached such heights that the New York Times bought it earlier this year, while TikTok creators live-stream themselves playing it.

What's the best Wordle starting word?

The goal of Wordle is to have fun, and there's no right way to have fun. Just choose whatever starting word feels right to you, and don't let anyone shame you for it. However, if you want to take a more strategic approach, we have a few ideas to help you pick a word that will spark joy. One tip is to select a word that includes at least two different vowels, plus some common consonants like S, T, R, or N.

What happened to the Wordle archive?

The entire archive of past Wordles used to be available for anyone to play in glorious days gone by. Unfortunately it has since been taken down, with the website's creator stating it was done at the request of the New York Times.

Is Wordle getting harder?

If you're finding Wordle too easy, you can try enabling its Hard Mode to give your brain a tougher challenge. But Wordle isn't getting any harder by itself — it's the same difficulty that it's always been.

Why are there two different Wordle answers some days?

Wordle is a fun, collective experience specifically because everyone's solving for the same word every day. Occasionally, though, Wordle has accepted two different solutions as correct on the same day. This is because the New York Times made changes to the Wordle word list after acquiring it, and sometimes swaps out words from the original list. To ensure you're getting the right answer every day, refresh your browser before you play — the site will save your streak.

Here's a subtle hint for today's Wordle answer:

If you get this wrong, it could be damaging.

Judging by the stans that cluster in his replies, Elon Musk's $44 billion buyout of Twitter was a scene out of a Marvel movie. Never mind Iron Man; they posted pictures of Musk as Captain America. After this hero fired four people, they also gleefully posted pictures of Musk as Thanos – perhaps forgetting that Thanos caused untold damage and was ultimately defeated once the planet's most powerful defenders banded together against him.

"The bird is freed," Musk tweeted . It was Orwellian language from someone who just took a public company and stuffed it into a private cage. The bird is not free; the bird is shackled to a consortium that includes Musk, banks, fellow billionaires, and various Saudi investors. Whatever happens to the bird next, whether it lives or dies, is less in Musk's court than anyone thinks.

Still, the bird stuff sounded superheroic to the stans, many of whom were agitating for the "freedom" of banned accounts, like a certain ex-president who used Twitter to help incite a coup. Musk had said in May that he'd restore Trump's account.

Musk, as we're all starting to learn by now, says a lot of things to a lot of people.

Soon enough, Musk's tweets started to sound less Avengers, more The Hangover. The supposed troll savior announced a "content moderation council with widely diverse viewpoints" would be formed prior to any "major content decisions or account reinstatements": So much for anyone expecting a Trump reinstatement before the midterms. He made vague "I'll be digging into it" promises on that perennially vague complaint, "shadowbanning," to a Trump-supporting account named Catturd , as if he were a bored customer service rep and not the billionaire owner.

Musk is all carnival barker, no bite

And as for all those supposed firings? The 75 percent of the company that Musk had talked tough about removing ? Beyond the immediate removal of CEO Parag Agrawal and three other executives, no other oustings have been announced. Bloomberg and CNBC were taken in by a couple of pranksters claiming to be just-fired data engineers outside Twitter HQ, though. (Musk, a teenage boy at heart, later saluted the prankster who gave his name as "Ligma.")

Guess we'll wait to see if Mr. "Let the Good Times Roll" actually aims to make it rain pink slips at the holidays. But at least for now, it seems that Musk – a seasoned showman since his early Twitter days – is all carnival barker, no bite.

Because here's the thing: No matter what happens now, Musk is going to run headlong into reality, regulators, and simple business sense. He overpaid for Twitter, couldn't find a way to back out of the deal, and now he must make it make money or risk the wrath of his fellow investors. Social media experts cannot foretell what will happen next, but they do seem to believe Musk has bitten off a more complex political problem than he can chew.



Running a global content company with no prior experience is difficult — especially when investors are breathing down your neck and sophisticated government influence operations are everywhere. It means not spooking advertisers (who Musk preemptively courted by promising "Twitter obviously cannot become a free-for-all hellscape." Ya think?) It means not annoying the majority of users who just want the Nazis to be banned and stay banned, some of whom are threatening to make the platform as worthless as Tumblr after Yahoo bought it . And it means not courting a revolt by the employees who actually run the shiny machinery you just bought.

Oh yeah, and it means playing nice with the European Union. With 450 million people, the EU has more potential Twitter users (and Tesla buyers!) than the United States, and it has much stricter laws safeguarding internet users' rights.

Those "accept cookies" pop-ups you keep getting, which (in theory) cut down on the number of companies tracking you? Largely the doing of the EU regulation known as GDPR. Now here comes the Digital Services Act, which just received final approval from the EU Parliament and Council. The DSA sets standards for content moderation, aims to fight disinformation, and was praised by Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen as "the gold standard" for keeping social media giants in check with minimal regulation.

European Commissioner Thierry Breton reminded Musk of his DSA obligations immediately after the Twitter sale went through – "the bird will fly by our rules" – and Musk had no response. Not even his classic bomb-throwing "LOL" emoji. How could he? He's in a video with Breton announcing their joint support for the DSA back in May.

And what's Musk going to do if he gets on the wrong side of European law? Pull every Twitter office, every Twitter server, out of an entire continent that also buys his overpriced electric cars? Seasoned Euro watchers are already preparing the popcorn.



To recap, then: a billionaire with a habit of founding (or pretending to found) new companies got addicted to Twitter. He became so intoxicated by the validation, he bought the platform at huge cost. He had a simplistic libertarian view of free speech and a blind spot for hate speech (and the laws against it). He told friends he was going to fire thousands of workers; he told bankers he was going to hire thousands of workers to create more value.

He walked into the offices, made a dad joke , hung around chatting, fired four big names to appease his horde. Then as reality set in and he was reminded that laws and regulations exist, he decided to punt the content moderation question to a committee – just as Zuckerberg found himself doing with the Oversight Board, which itself punted on the big Trump ban question .

Turns out running a social media company isn't as easy as it looked before the takeover. Musk may soon get bored with his complicated new toy, wary of turning off too many customers and advertisers, and decide to delegate most of the big decisions to a team that keeps Twitter chugging along pretty much as is.

In which case, there may not be enough popcorn in the world for the disappointment of those stans. Sooner or later, they may realize they weren't caping for a Marvel superhero, but a bored billionaire who never really cared for them in the first place.

"The bird is freed," Musk tweeted . It was Orwellian language from someone who just took a public company and stuffed it into a private cage. The bird is not free; the bird is shackled to a consortium that includes Musk, banks, fellow billionaires, and various Saudi investors. Whatever happens to the bird next, whether it lives or dies, is less in Musk's court than anyone thinks.

Still, the bird stuff sounded superheroic to the stans, many of whom were agitating for the "freedom" of banned accounts, like a certain ex-president who used Twitter to help incite a coup. Musk had said in May that he'd restore Trump's account.

Musk, as we're all starting to learn by now, says a lot of things to a lot of people.

Soon enough, Musk's tweets started to sound less Avengers, more The Hangover. The supposed troll savior announced a "content moderation council with widely diverse viewpoints" would be formed prior to any "major content decisions or account reinstatements": So much for anyone expecting a Trump reinstatement before the midterms. He made vague "I'll be digging into it" promises on that perennially vague complaint, "shadowbanning," to a Trump-supporting account named Catturd , as if he were a bored customer service rep and not the billionaire owner.

Musk is all carnival barker, no bite

And as for all those supposed firings? The 75 percent of the company that Musk had talked tough about removing ? Beyond the immediate removal of CEO Parag Agrawal and three other executives, no other oustings have been announced. Bloomberg and CNBC were taken in by a couple of pranksters claiming to be just-fired data engineers outside Twitter HQ, though. (Musk, a teenage boy at heart, later saluted the prankster who gave his name as "Ligma.")

Guess we'll wait to see if Mr. "Let the Good Times Roll" actually aims to make it rain pink slips at the holidays. But at least for now, it seems that Musk – a seasoned showman since his early Twitter days – is all carnival barker, no bite.

Because here's the thing: No matter what happens now, Musk is going to run headlong into reality, regulators, and simple business sense. He overpaid for Twitter, couldn't find a way to back out of the deal, and now he must make it make money or risk the wrath of his fellow investors. Social media experts cannot foretell what will happen next, but they do seem to believe Musk has bitten off a more complex political problem than he can chew.



Running a global content company with no prior experience is difficult — especially when investors are breathing down your neck and sophisticated government influence operations are everywhere. It means not spooking advertisers (who Musk preemptively courted by promising "Twitter obviously cannot become a free-for-all hellscape." Ya think?) It means not annoying the majority of users who just want the Nazis to be banned and stay banned, some of whom are threatening to make the platform as worthless as Tumblr after Yahoo bought it . And it means not courting a revolt by the employees who actually run the shiny machinery you just bought.

Oh yeah, and it means playing nice with the European Union. With 450 million people, the EU has more potential Twitter users (and Tesla buyers!) than the United States, and it has much stricter laws safeguarding internet users' rights.

Those "accept cookies" pop-ups you keep getting, which (in theory) cut down on the number of companies tracking you? Largely the doing of the EU regulation known as GDPR. Now here comes the Digital Services Act, which just received final approval from the EU Parliament and Council. The DSA sets standards for content moderation, aims to fight disinformation, and was praised by Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen as "the gold standard" for keeping social media giants in check with minimal regulation.

European Commissioner Thierry Breton reminded Musk of his DSA obligations immediately after the Twitter sale went through – "the bird will fly by our rules" – and Musk had no response. Not even his classic bomb-throwing "LOL" emoji. How could he? He's in a video with Breton announcing their joint support for the DSA back in May.

And what's Musk going to do if he gets on the wrong side of European law? Pull every Twitter office, every Twitter server, out of an entire continent that also buys his overpriced electric cars? Seasoned Euro watchers are already preparing the popcorn.



To recap, then: a billionaire with a habit of founding (or pretending to found) new companies got addicted to Twitter. He became so intoxicated by the validation, he bought the platform at huge cost. He had a simplistic libertarian view of free speech and a blind spot for hate speech (and the laws against it). He told friends he was going to fire thousands of workers; he told bankers he was going to hire thousands of workers to create more value.

He walked into the offices, made a dad joke , hung around chatting, fired four big names to appease his horde. Then as reality set in and he was reminded that laws and regulations exist, he decided to punt the content moderation question to a committee – just as Zuckerberg found himself doing with the Oversight Board, which itself punted on the big Trump ban question .

Turns out running a social media company isn't as easy as it looked before the takeover. Musk may soon get bored with his complicated new toy, wary of turning off too many customers and advertisers, and decide to delegate most of the big decisions to a team that keeps Twitter chugging along pretty much as is.

In which case, there may not be enough popcorn in the world for the disappointment of those stans. Sooner or later, they may realize they weren't caping for a Marvel superhero, but a bored billionaire who never really cared for them in the first place.
Elon Musk officially owns Twitter now and it's cause for celebration in some conservative circles. The new 'Chief Twit' has already made public his intentions to bring back right-wing accounts that were banned after breaking Twitter's rule

But now that Musk is intent on making Twitter more "red," where does that leave other alternative conservative platforms like Truth Social and Parler? How will they be affected by Elon Musk's Twitter acquisition?

The truth is…nothing much will change for these social media sites. These platforms barely get any traction to begin with.

Take Parler, for example. This alternative conservative social network has recently been in the news thanks to rapper Kanye West, who claims he's going to buy the platform. According to the most recent Comscore data, Parler receives roughly 137,000 unique visitors per month. The platform has been on the decline since its peak in January 2021. The week before the Kanye news gave Parler a slight bump, its mobile app was only pulling in around 17,000 installs, according to mobile analytics firm SensorTower.

For comparison, Twitter so far has received 153 million installs of its mobile app this year, according to SensorTower. It currently has 238 million daily active users.

Former president Donald Trump's TruthSocial is easily the biggest current alternative conservative social media platform. However, because it was so late to the game — it was launched in February 2022, more than a year after Trump was banned from Twitter — it was dwarfed by its dying competitors. According to SensorTower, TruthSocial has seen a cumulative total of approximately 3.8 million installs, compared to Parler's total of 11.7 million installs and ghost town Gettr's 7.4 million. (All look tiny when compared to Twitter's 1.3 billion installs since 2014.)

Still, Truth Social remains the most active of the bunch. Why? Because of Donald Trump. The platform has morphed from its original idea of being an alternative Twitter into literally just a place for conservatives to grovel in the replies to Trump's posts. And when they're not doing that, they're spreading conspiracy theories in the hope that Trump will notice and share them.

Trump has nearly 4.4 million followers on the Truth Social platform. That's close to the entirety of its users. They are there for him. And Trump says he's staying solely on the financially struggling Truth Social, too.

The problem for these alternative conservative platforms is that they primarily appeal to the group of conservatives who want to preach to the choir. For the subsection of this audience intent on sparring with the other side of the political spectrum (to "own the libs"), a conservative-only platform was always a turnoff.

So, even with Musk owning Twitter, the state of conservative social media platforms remains…pretty much the same. Sites like Parler and Gettr will continue to struggle to find an audience. Other platforms like the white-supremacist-friendly Gab will carry on catering to its extremist niche. And Truth Social will continue chugging along as a Donald Trump fan club.

As for Musk, well, he still has to keep advertisers happy to justify his $44 billion purchase and he's already hedging just a bit on his plans. For example, on Friday afternoon, Musk said he would be putting together a "content moderation council" to review major content decisions and account reinstatements before they happen.

So, at least for now, the options for right-wing social media users are to either play ball with Twitter's rules or go kick rocks in social media's conservative ghost towns.

Pranksters fooled some media members into thinking they'd been laid off by Elon Musk soon after his Twitter takeover. In reality, they were making reference to a common internet joke involving testicles. Yeah. Not great.

A few different media members and media outlets posted about Twitter employees leaving the company's HQ, boxes of personal belongings in hand. One of the more prominent posts came from CNBC's Deirdre Bosa, who posted that an "entire team of data engineers" had been let go.

Folks soon followed up to Bosa and others noting that one of the pranksters had told reporters their name was "Rahul Ligma." For those not terminally online, that's a joke about, well, there's no delicate way to put this...balls. Because Ligma sounds like lick my and then...you can guess where the joke typically goes. It's juvenile and dumb, sure. But that's the internet, baby.

A handful of outlets, like CNBC and Bloomberg, initially fell for the hoax. Both outlets issued statements and changed their stories. Bosa tweeted: "fyi -some questions being raised about whether these are really twitter employees."

There were some other clues the actors might not have been on the up-and-up. As The Verge noted, one of them says, "It makes me worry about the future of our democracy...the future of celebrity conservatorship. I mean, when Britney [Spears] happened..."

The Verge also reported that they confirmed the identity of "Ligma" and that they were not a Twitter employee.

Also the person who said their name was Ligma randomly held up a picture of Michelle Obama and said, "Michelle Obama wouldn’t have happened if Elon Musk owned Twitter." That might've been a clue.

Yeah, so, it was questionable, at best. To be fair to the media outlets, it's a pretty strange thing to fake, especially considering Musk did lay off top executives after taking over Twitter. It also came out that he floated the idea of firing 75 percent of Twitter employees.

Musk, famous for a juvenile sense of humor and distrust of the media, of course commented on the Ligma hoax soon after it broke. "Ligma Johnson had it coming," he joked.

The real mass layoffs might still come. But for now, at least the fake ones seemed to make Twitter's new owner laugh.

It's our first day on Elon Musk's Twitter, and users are already plotting the platform's demise. They say the fastest way to make Musk regret (and lose money) on his $44 billion Twitter acquisition is to obliterate the app's value. And the easiest way to do that? Follow the lead of 2013-era Tumblr users.

In 2013, Tumblr sold to Yahoo for more than $1 billion and lost value almost immediately. Users exacerbated Yahoo's poor management by making Tumblr even weirder and wilder. Yahoo never recouped on its purchase and sold it off at a loss as a part of a larger acquisition deal with Verizon in 2017. Verizon couldn't figure out what to do with Tumblr either and reportedly sold to the creator of Wordpress for a teensy $3 million in 2019.

Now tweeters are conspiring to help Twitter suffer a similar fate by shitposting and furry-fying Musk. My only question is... will trolling have any effect at all on meme lord Elon Musk? He is infinitely more well-versed in the wiles of the internet than Yahoo has ever been.

We're gonna Tumblr this bird app

Marissa Meyer never saw it coming...

A single fish > Tumblr

But don't bring MySpace into this

Teamwork makes the dream work (and killed Tumblr)

Crank up the shit posting output, stat

And if all else fails, make Elon Musk a furry

Get in, loser! We're going back to the future of 2013

Elon Musk just spent a whopping $44 billion on Twitter, a social media platform with nearly 400 million users around the globe.

So, what are his day one priorities? Apparently, they consist of looking into a complaint from an anonymous right-wing troll about how they lost 1,200 followers the other day.

Late Thursday night, the deal was finally sealed between Elon Musk and Twitter, ending a months-long saga which resulted in Musk overpaying to acquire the platform and taking it private.

SEE ALSO: Twitter users plot revenge on Elon Musk by killing the platform

Musk took to Twitter last night to announce the change in ownership with a tweet.

"the bird is freed," posted Musk.

Elon Musk, customer support representative

His very next tweet — which was his very first reply to another user as Twitter's new owner — was a response to the anonymous right-wing Twitter user "@catturd2," a user who was frequently retweeted by former president Donald Trump before Trump was suspended from the platform in January 2021.

The tweet that Musk responded to was a complaint from @catturd2 saying he was "still Shadowbanned, ghostbanned, searchbanned, and Twitter removed 1200 followers today - as usual."

It's worth noting that @catturd2 has more than 850,000 followers and that his tweet had tens of thousands of likes before Musk even replied to it. These are huge numbers that would put him in the upper echelon of Twitter users, making his claims of being persecuted by Twitter pretty nonsensical.

Nevertheless, Musk personally reached out.

"I will be digging in more today," replied Musk.

After Musk's reply, @catturd2 quickly responded that he gained thousands of followers and chalked it up to Twitter's new owner for quickly making changes that enabled this. Logically minded individuals would note that @catturd2 likely gained followers because Musk replied to him and not because sweeping changes were made to the Twitter algorithm within the 20-minute time span in which this all occurred.

Is Musk going to personally respond to every influential right-wing figure in order to help satiate their complete misunderstanding of how social media works? Time will tell.

Musk did say that one of his goals at Twitter would be to take on bots and fake accounts. But the question remains: How is he going to remove these accounts without angering the @catturd2s of Twitter? Everyone on the platform (and across the political divide) has at least a few fake followers. And the larger the account, the more fake followers they have. If Musk follows through on his plan, accounts like @catturd2 will certainly blame him for the removal of hundreds of thousands of fake followers. How will Musk respond to attacks from right-wing accounts then?

Elon Musk needs to solve the Elon Musk problem

But Musk actually has a more pressing problem to attend to: Himself.

Early Thursday morning, Elon Musk tweeted a statement out to Twitter advertisers who expressed concern over continuing their marketing on Musk's version of Twitter. He attempted to calm their fears by claiming he would not let Twitter become a "free-for-all hellscape" and said his plans are a response to fears social media would splinter into partisan echo chambers.

But, Elon Musk is obviously in a right-wing echo chamber himself. Musk's personal texts , which were released as part of the original Twitter trial proceedings, show him texting with a number of right-wing partisans, some of whom even recommended he hire current Republican congressional candidates.

Another interesting conversation gleaned from Musk's court-submitted texts has to do with one contact who is allegedly his ex-wife Talulah Riley. The two were conversing about the Twitter suspension of a conservative (self-proclaimed) parody website that misgenders trans people, an account that was in violation of Twitter's rules at the time.

"Please do something to fight woke-ism," Musk's contact begged him.

His own personal right-wing echo chamber

Musk is clearly surrounded by right-wingers.

And his day one attempt to investigate a right-wing user's follower count wasn't a one-off, either. Soon after replying to @catturd2, his very next reply was to a Twitter account belonging to a right-wing organization called Canada Proud that was seeking his help with censorship concerns in Canada.

Despite what conservative activists think, Big Tech is not a left-wing utopia. It is, in fact, fully owned by the right. These are dyed-in-the-wool capitalists. Twitter's board literally sued Musk to force him to respect his legal agreement to buy the company because they valued their own personal payday over the livelihoods of their workers. (Remember: Musk has plans for big layoffs.) Twitter's executives get to walk away with multimillion-dollar payouts while the employees that Musk plans to fire will have to worry about their next paycheck.

And it's not just on the business end of things either. Social media companies very specifically have a history of kowtowing to right-wing users. Mark Zuckerberg, for example, feared angering right-wing influencers so much that they were given special treatment to spread misinformation on Facebook.

It is notable how Musk doesn't mind making it blatantly obvious where his true intentions lie.

Musk may be in charge of Twitter now, but he's still beholden to a powerful group: Advertisers. After all, he does have to pay back his loans and please his investors somehow. Perhaps it would be smart for him to take his own advice and exit his echo chamber.

Or, maybe he can just continue his new profession as a personal social media concierge service for right-wing social media addicts. Twitter can probably still scrounge up the same advertisers that conservative media attracts: MyPillow and the gold coin salesmen. Surely that revenue will make the $44 billion purchase worth it.

So, what's everyone been watching this week? Hmmmm?

Just to get a sense of what everyone's streaming, we've used data from streaming aggregator Reelgood, which gathers viewership numbers from hundreds of streaming services in the U.S. and UK. Each week, the most streamed TV shows and movies come down to a few elements — sheer buzz, a big finale, smart marketing, star power, critical acclaim, or word-of-mouth that leads uninterested people to finally watch it out of spite.

This week, with Halloween almost here, the scarier watches are ramping up, with Netflix's The Watcher, Halloween Ends, American Horror Story: NYC, and Barbarian all making the top 10.

But just because a lot of people are watching something doesn't make it...good. Here they are, the 10 most streamed TV shows and movies of the week, where to watch them, and what Mashable critics thought.

Based on a true case. Credit: Netflix

Ryan Murphy's latest production is getting all the streams this week, a seven-episode horror anthology based on true crime stories. Based on a 2018 article published by The Cut, The Watcher is centred on New Jersey residents the Brannock family, who start receiving highly unsettling letters from an anonymous author. The Watcher is based on a real case, and the makers got permission from the family who actually lived through it (unlike the makers of Netflix's Dahmer series). — Shannon Connellan, UK Editor

2. The Peripheral

Based on William Gibson's 2014 novel of the same name, The Peripheral stars Chloë Grace Moretz as Flynne Fisher, a woman who tests out some new VR technology only to find herself in a futuristic new world with IRL consequences. Exec produced by Westworld creators Lisa Joy and Jonathan Nolan, this one looks like a tense blend of The Matrix and Black Mirror. — Sam Haysom, Deputy UK Editor

Jamie Lee Curtis is ready to shut this guy down once and for all. Credit: Universal

Laurie Strode has been fighting the same Haddonfield monster since 1978, when Michael Myers first barged his way into a closet and into horror history with the first Halloween. And now, the saga is ending (probably) after 45 years, with Jamie Lee Curtis returning to her iconic role to take on the masked murderer one last time. In the last film of the relaunched franchise following 2018's Halloween and Halloween Kills, the David Gordon Green-directed Halloween Ends promises to do exactly that: pit Laurie and Michael against each other for the ultimate showdown.

Set four years since the events of the last film, this time Laurie is writing her memoir while living with her granddaughter Allyson (Andi Matichak) and seemingly free from her tormentor.

There is simply no denying the power of Game of Thrones, a franchise that has roared back into our lives with the release of prequel series House of the Dragon. Taking place nearly 200 years before Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen existed, House of the Dragon follows House Targaryen at the height of its power in Westeros. There's just one small problem: King Viserys (Paddy Considine) doesn't have a male heir. With the line of succession in question, you can bet on scheming, bloodshed, and mayhem. Oh, and many, many dragons. Let fire and blood reign! — Belen Edwards, Entertainment Reporter

What we thought: If you're worried about House of the Dragon after getting burned by the final season of Game of Thrones, don't be. HBO's epic new series is excellent through and through, juggling memorable characters, high fantasy, and intense emotions with practiced ease. You'll be sucked in faster than you can say "Dracarys." — B.E.

Turns out Bill Skarsgård doesn't even need clown makeup to be scary. Zach Cregger's horror sees Tess (Georgina Campbell) arriving at her AirBnb only to find it already occupied. A stranger called Keith (Skarsgård) is there, but she decides to crash with him after realising it's late and she has nowhere else to stay. As you can probably imagine, this turns out to be a bad idea. — S.H.

Based on Soman Chainani's popular YA fantasy series, Paul Feig's The School for Good and Evil sees best pals Sophie (Sophia Anne Caruso) and Agatha (Sofia Wylie) whisked off to an enchanted school where heroes and villains get their training. The movie is packed with big names and cameos (hello, Charlize Theron and Kerry Washington) but, as Mashable's Shannon Connellan explained, it simply needs way more Rachel Bloom. — S.H.

7. Terrifier

It must be Halloween because Damien Leone's 2016 film Terrifer is one of the most streamed of the week — the sequel is out Oct. 24, and is also reportedly making viewers vomit and pass out, so that also helps. David Howard Thornton stars as Art, a murderous clown who's after Tara, Vicky, and Dawn (Jenna Kanell, Samantha Scaffidi, Catherine Corcoran) on the scariest night of the year. — S.C.

Star Wars's latest adventure is one of the most popular series this week, with Diego Luna in the lead and back in his 2016 Rogue One: A Star Wars Story role of Cassian Andor before he joins the Rebellion. In the prequel series Andor, you'll also get an early peek at the tale of Senator Mon Mothma (Genevieve O'Reilly). Rounding out the cast is Stellan Skarsgård, Adria Arjona, Fiona Shaw, Denise Gough, and Kyle Soller.* — S.C.

Based on Kate Kyriacou's non-fiction book The Sting: The Undercover Operation That Caught Daniel Morcombe's Killer, The Stranger follows the real-life child abduction case that saw an officer (played by Joel Edgerton) going undercover to befriend the main suspect (played by Sean Harris). Although the movie is popular, it's worth noting that Daniel Morcombe's parents have spoken out about it, describing the film as "callously disrespectful". — S.H.

Welcome to a new chapter. Credit: YouTube/FX Networks

With a cult following built up over 10 seasons, it's really no surprise that Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk's latest American Horror Story series (this time set in New York City) is in the top 10 this week. Behold the teaser, which is packed full of leather, needles, and blood — brace yourself. — S.H.

So, what's everyone been watching this week? Hmmmm?

Just to get a sense of what everyone's streaming, we've used data from streaming aggregator Reelgood, which gathers viewership numbers from hundreds of streaming services in the U.S. and UK. Each week, the most streamed TV shows and movies come down to a few elements — sheer buzz, a big finale, smart marketing, star power, critical acclaim, or word-of-mouth that leads uninterested people to finally watch it out of spite.

This week, with Halloween almost here, the scarier watches are ramping up, with Netflix's The Watcher, Halloween Ends, American Horror Story: NYC, and Barbarian all making the top 10.

But just because a lot of people are watching something doesn't make it...good. Here they are, the 10 most streamed TV shows and movies of the week, where to watch them, and what Mashable critics thought.

Ryan Murphy's latest production is getting all the streams this week, a seven-episode horror anthology based on true crime stories. Based on a 2018 article published by The Cut, The Watcher is centred on New Jersey residents the Brannock family, who start receiving highly unsettling letters from an anonymous author. The Watcher is based on a real case, and the makers got permission from the family who actually lived through it (unlike the makers of Netflix's Dahmer series). — Shannon Connellan, UK Editor

Based on William Gibson's 2014 novel of the same name, The Peripheral stars Chloë Grace Moretz as Flynne Fisher, a woman who tests out some new VR technology only to find herself in a futuristic new world with IRL consequences. Exec produced by Westworld creators Lisa Joy and Jonathan Nolan, this one looks like a tense blend of The Matrix and Black Mirror. — Sam Haysom, Deputy UK Editor

Laurie Strode has been fighting the same Haddonfield monster since 1978, when Michael Myers first barged his way into a closet and into horror history with the first Halloween. And now, the saga is ending (probably) after 45 years, with Jamie Lee Curtis returning to her iconic role to take on the masked murderer one last time. In the last film of the relaunched franchise following 2018's Halloween and Halloween Kills, the David Gordon Green-directed Halloween Ends promises to do exactly that: pit Laurie and Michael against each other for the ultimate showdown.

Set four years since the events of the last film, this time Laurie is writing her memoir while living with her granddaughter Allyson (Andi Matichak) and seemingly free from her tormentor. But when a babysitter, Corey Cunningham (Rohan Campbell) is accused of murder, a series of violent events can only mean one thing. — S.C.

Welcome to AirFryDay, where — you guessed it — every Friday Mashable covers the latest trends, dispenses advice, and reviews recipes for your air fryer.

Spoiler alert: Mozzarella sticks are good. Even average mozzarella sticks are pretty dang tasty. Crunchy, melty, hot cheese? There is literally no way to make that bad.

So, yes, this TikTok recipe from @arimonika for homemade mozzarella sticks is tasty...because you're making mozzarella sticks. Now, of course, you could easily keep frozen mozz sticks in your freezer and come up with a decent product. Along with roasting vegetables, cooking frozen foods is one of the most practical and useful applications for the air fryer. This TikTok recipe, however, is a nice, fresh alternative. It takes just a bit of effort and at the end you're rewarded with melty cheese. And it'll be at least marginally healthier than the deep-fried version. So that's nice.

Here's was you need to know to make the recipe.

Ingredients

1 pound block of mozzarella cheese

3 eggs

1/2 cup of all purpose flour

1.5 cups of breadcrumbs

1 small jar of marinara.

Directions

Slice the block of mozzarella into planks that are roughly mozzarella-stick shaped. Next we're doing the classic breading procedure: Dredge and cover each plank with flour, then dip into the egg, then completely cover with breadcrumbs. For even more crunch, dip the breaded mozz stick back into the egg, then back again into the breadcrumbs. Spray your air fryer basket then air fry at 350 degrees for about nine minutes, or until breadcrumbs look nice and toasty. Dip in the marinara and enjoy!

The details

First things first, here is how the finished product looked for @arimonika.

Tasty looking, right?

My final product looked pretty similar.

Crispy. Credit: Mashable

There is, however, one change I'd likely make moving forward. I'd swap in Italian-style seasoned breadcrumbs for the panko breadcrumbs I used. For most applications, I prefer panko, but I think traditional, smaller-grain breadcrumbs would give you better cheese coverage and texture. The final product would be closer to the mozz sticks we all know and love. The panko breadcrumbs were a bit too craggy and didn't cling as well as traditional breadcrumbs might've. Learn from my mistake.

Now, that being said, my mozzarella sticks were still tasty. I did lose a little bit of cheese to leakage during the cooking process, but I still got melty, crunchy mozz sticks. There is nothing wrong with that, my friend.

If you happen to be the sort of person who keeps mozzarella sticks in the freezer, then I'm not sure it's worth making this homemade version. After all, with the frozen bag of mozz sticks you don't end up with eggy fingers. You'll also likely loose less cheese to leakage because the mozzarella starts out frozen, meaning it won't turn liquid and melt out.

But this is a fun, easy recipe that'll give you a tasty result in a pinch. It would also certainly be a fun project for a family to make together. In the end, it's crispy, melty cheese. And that is always a good thing.

So now the long wait begins.

House of the Dragon's fiery first season came to a tense conclusion on Sunday, with the prospect of a violent civil war accelerated by an unfortunate mid-air collision between angry dragons.

The Hightowers and Rhaenyra are at each other's throats, both sides are already making tactical moves, and – to put it plainly – everything in Westeros is about to kick off.

Ending on such a big cliffhanger in Targaryen history, though, has left us with questions. So many questions. And while we won't be able to definitively answer them until season 2 arrives, we've taken a stab at some of the bigger ones below...

1. What will Rhaenyra do next?

Tricky decisions ahead. Credit: HBO

The final shot of the finale is Rhaenyra's angry, tear-streaked face staring into the camera. She's just heard the news of her son Lucerys' death, and you can tell from her expression that any previous thoughts of peaceful compromise have gone out the window. But where exactly does she go from here?

Part of this question was already answered for us in the finale. Rhaenyra has already begun making moves, sending her oldest son Jacaerys to meet with the Northern houses in an attempt to win more allies, while Rhaenys heads out to the Narrow Sea to patrol the water on dragon back and provide air support to Lord Corlys. If we had to guess, these plans will remain in place, but Rhaenyra will no longer be taking any prisoners. It'll be a "scream Dracarys first, ask questions later" kind of deal. And speaking of dragons, we're guessing she'll be taking Daemon's advice of recruiting as many wild ones as possible (more on that later).

2. Which Houses will side with Rhaenyra?

Friend or foe? Credit: HBO

You can't win a war without allies. In the finale, we see Rhaenyra and co. discussing which Houses in Westeros might want to side with them, resulting in Rhaenyra's sons going off to meet with Houses Baratheon, Arryn, and Stark.

House Baratheon, Lucerys quickly discovers, is a dead end. The Lannisters are also a no-go. But what about the Arryns and the Starks? Well, the good news is Lady Jane Arryn is the cousin of Rhaenyra's mother, Aemma, and as Rhaenyra says in the finale, "The Vale will not turn cloak against their own kin." As we know from the good old Game of Thrones days, the Starks are also famously honourable. In episode 1, we saw Lord Rickon Stark swearing allegiance to Rhaenyra. So, providing his son, Lord Cregan, follows in the traditions of his House, Jacaerys may have more luck as an envoy than his brother did — and Rhaenyra may find a valuable ally in the North.

The Riverlands, meanwhile, are "key" according to Daemon, and last we heard he was planning to go there himself. But as Rhaenyra says, "Lord Grover is fickle and easily swayed." It sounds like this one could go either way.

3. Will Daemon recruit more dragons?

What big teeth you have. Credit: HBO

While Rhaenyra works to shore up allies, Daemon has another objective in mind: Getting more dragons. In the finale, we see him journeying under the Dragonmont on Dragonstone, where he encounters Vermithor, one of three "unclaimed" dragons that he mentions earlier in the episode. The others are Silverwing, which is also on Dragonstone, and Seasmoke – Laenor Velayron's old dragon – which is on Driftmark.

Featured Video For You 'Game of Thrones' star Lena Headey reveals she was 'gutted' by Cersei's death

Clearly a big part of early season 2 will involve him trying to amass as many dragons as possible. But will he be successful? Well, the early signs are positive. When he meets Vermithor, Daemon sings in High Valyrian and the dragon doesn't immediately coat him in flames or chomp his head off, which seems like a solid start. There's also some foreshadowing earlier in season 1 that implies Rhaenyra's side will get at least one more dragon. Back in episode 6, there's a scene where Rhaena Targaryen – the daughter of Daemon and Laena – expresses her disappointment at not having a dragon. Her mother's response? "If you wish to be a rider, you must claim that right."

It's surely no coincidence that when Daemon speaks of unclaimed dragons in the finale, the camera cuts to Rhaena's face. Maybe she'll be the one to ride Vermithor?

4. Will there be a rift between Alicent and her father, Otto?

No love lost. Credit: HBO

The problem with making it to the top is that you typically have to rely on the support of some fairly ruthless people in order to get there. Alicent was forced to be her father's pawn for a number of years, and in the finale she makes it clear that she sees him for who he really is. They've already clashed over tactics – Alicent wanted to send terms to Rhaenyra, while Otto favoured killing her outright – which resulted in Larys Strong offering to take out the White Worm (a powerful King's Landing informant) for Alicent in order to cut off Otto's information source.

The question is, will Larys double-cross Alicent? And either way, can her relationship with her father go anywhere other than downhill as outright war draws closer?

5. And will there be a rift between Rhaenyra and Daemon?

The cracks are starting to show. Credit: HBO

Speaking of frayed relationships, Rhaenyra's marriage to Daemon isn't looking good either. In the final episode, his hunger to rush to war clashes with her desire for restraint, culminating in an unpleasant scene in which he chokes her after she tells him about the Song of Ice and Fire prophecy passed down to her by her father.

So will the impending war bring them together, or push them apart? As we mentioned earlier, the final shot of Rhaenyra makes it seem like she's done playing nice. This could mean that her and Daemon may actually be closer aligned on what to do about the Greens, as Daemon is already naturally revenge-set. On the other hand, it's difficult to call. Fundamentally, although she can be ruthless, Rhaenyra is nowhere near as impulsive as Daemon. In a war setting, it's easy to imagine them having more disagreements, especially as Daemon's problem with authority might mean he refuses to listen to her commands.

6. Will the Triarchy form a temporary alliance with the Greens?

The Crabfeeder is no more, but the Triarchy lives on. Credit: HBO

The Free Cities have been the only real external threat in House of the Dragon season 1, with the pesky Triarchy constantly attempting to take over the Stepstones — the archipelago stretching across the Narrow Sea between Westeros and Essos.

Daemon beat them back by defeating the Crabfeeder earlier in the season, and Lord Corlys has just returned from defeating them once again, this time establishing full control of the Narrow Sea. The thing is, though, the Triarchy are clearly still out there — and they're not going to be happy about being beaten back.

Would it be such a stretch for the Hightowers to reach out to them in season 2 in order to try and form a temporary allegiance? Given that Daemon and Lord Corlys were the ones leading the battle against them, and not the Hightowers, it might not be out of the question.

7. What's currently going on beyond the Wall?

What's the Night King up to these days? Credit: HBO

Will season 2 of House of the Dragon – or any future season, for that matter – take us beyond the Wall? It's hard to know, but the frequent mentions of the Song of Ice and Fire prophecy (plus the maybe-accidental-maybe-not similarity between Aemond's sapphire eye and the White Walkers) certainly make it seem possible.

We know the Night King was made by the Children of Men many thousands of years ago, so he's currently out there somewhere — whether or not he makes a cameo, though, especially with the action so focussed on King's Landing, is difficult to predict.
So now the long wait begins.

Daemon beat them back by defeating the Crabfeeder earlier in the season, and Lord Corlys has just returned from defeating them once again, this time establishing full control of the Narrow Sea. The thing is, though, the Triarchy are clearly still out there — and they're not going to be happy about being beaten back.

Would it be such a stretch for the Hightowers to reach out to them in season 2 in order to try and form a temporary allegiance? Given that Daemon and Lord Corlys were the ones leading the battle against them, and not the Hightowers, it might not be out of the question.

Will season 2 of House of the Dragon – or any future season, for that matter – take us beyond the Wall? It's hard to know, but the frequent mentions of the Song of Ice and Fire prophecy (plus the maybe-accidental-maybe-not similarity between Aemond's sapphire eye and the White Walkers) certainly make it seem possible.

We know the Night King was made by the Children of Men many thousands of years ago, so he's currently out there somewhere — whether or not he makes a cameo, though, especially with the action so focussed on King's Landing, is difficult to predict.
Now that "Chief Twit" Elon Musk has officially acquired Twitter, you might be thinking about leaving Twitter but wondering where to go.

If so, you're not alone. While some users are valiantly staying on the platform in protest, others are jumping ship. According to a Reuters report, Twitter is losing its most active users — "heavy tweeters" make up 10 percent of users but account for 90 percent of the platform's tweet. And now with Musk in charge, many users who are skeptical about his plans to curtail content moderation are saying they plan to quit Twitter altogether.

If you feel you have nothing left to give to the social media platform and are ready to move on from this Musk era, you've come to the right place. Below is a handy wellness guide for how to leave Twitter and start a new life beyond the scroll of doom.

Know the consequences

Technically, leaving Twitter is called "deactivating" your account. You can deactivate your Twitter account by going to Settings > Your account > Deactivate your account.

But before your take the leap, it's important to know what happens next. When you deactivate your account, you have 30 days to reactivate it if you change your mind. After 30 days, all your data is deleted. That's why this next step is critical to your Twitter exit strategy.

There's a way to download an archive of all of your tweets and data, so make sure you do that before you deactivate your account.

Here's a step-by-step guide of how to download your data. Note: Twitter says it may take up to 24 hours to process this request, so plan accordingly.

So you've got your data downloaded and you've deactivated your Twitter account. Now it's time to fill the Twitter-bird-shaped void in your life. That starts with finding alternative apps to replace the ritual of scrolling through tweets until your eyes bleed.

Here are some suggestions:

A decentralized network of social media servers.

Like a Facebook feed that's more customizable, so you'll have less engagement with your extremist distant relative and more contact with people you do want to be in touch with.

Essentially thematically-based chatrooms. Big with gamers.

If you miss the urge to broadcast your whereabouts, BeReal sends you a daily prompt to post a picture.

If you want a social media platform with less moderation than Elon's Twitter is about to have, there's always this right-wing ghost town. Heads-up though: No one, not even former President Donald Trump, is using the app.

If you still like your social media to be owned by an egotistical celebrity with no experience running a social media company, you're in luck! Kanye West is buying the controversial app where "Stop the Steal" conspiracy theories that led to the Jan. 6 insurrection thrived.

Social media heavy hitters

Of course, there are also the more established platforms, too: Facebook, Instagram, Reddit, TikTok, etc.

The point is, when you delete Twitter, it's likely you'll experience an intense urge to publicly voice your mundane thoughts and you'll need to pre-empt this urge by having alternative social media outlets to satisfy that urge.

Go undercover

If the thought of leaving Twitter altogether is causing too much separation anxiety, consider making a ghost account. If you cherish that precious blue checkmark beside your verified account and the followers you worked so hard for, a solution would be keeping that account and making a new stealth account a la a “finsta.” That way you can check your Twitter lists and keep tabs on the goings-on without subjecting yourself to the Twitter feed hellscape.

Alternative coping strategies

In the case of an emergency — say, your WiFi goes down, or you haven't found the right replacement app, or you simply miss the terrifying thrill of scrolling through Twitter — you need to have a backup plan for publicly sharing your opinions. For this, we recommend going out into the street and screaming what you might have ordinarily tweeted.

Another option: hanging one of those digital signs out of your window and updating it constantly.

Maybe you've decided to leave Twitter not just because of the toxic wasteland you fear it'll turn into under Musk's leadership, but because you need a break from the relentless pull of social media feeds in general. In that case, we recommend logging off, going outside, and touching grass.

"Though touching grass is an internet joke, is it time for us to silently step away and touch grass?" asks Catriona Morton for Mashable. "Can we take more from the advice to log off? And is it really possible to truly ‘touch grass’?"

We'd wager that, yes, it's possible and advisable.

It can be hard to remember there's a reality beyond the online world, so we recommend reacquainting yourself with it in baby steps. In addition to touching some grass, try smiling at someone, going for a walk, or maybe even licking a subway pole. When a stranger reciprocates your smile with a suspicious glare or you inevitably contract some heinous disease from that germ-infested pole, you'll know you're back in reality. Isn't that wonderful?

The idea of deleting Twitter and absconding into the woods continues to grow in appeal with each passing day. Yet even considering the sustained psychic damage this wretched hellsite continues to inflict upon us, it's difficult to simply let go and wipe away years of memes and hot takes. You worked hard on those jokes, after all.

Fortunately, leaving Twitter doesn't mean you have to delete all your tweets for good. Twitter lets you download an archive of your data, meaning you can keep a record of all your old posts for your own private joy and amusement even after you leave.

Here's how to download your tweet archive:

1. Open Twitter.

2. If you're on desktop, click on "More…" in the navigation bar on the left to reveal more options.

If you're on mobile, open the navigation bar by tapping on your profile picture in the top left corner.

It can take up to 24 hours for the file to be ready, at which point you will receive either a push notification on the mobile app or an email to your connected account. Of course, downloading your archive of Twitter data won't delete your account — you'll have to do that separately. But it might make the decision to do so feel a bit easier.

Europe is doing away with combustion engine cars.

On Thursday, the EU Council and the European Parliament reached an agreement that effectively bans combustion engine cars and vehicles from 2035 onwards.

More precisely, the agreement – which is yet to be formally adopted and may change before that happens – targets a 55 percent CO2 emission reduction target for new cars and 50 percent reduction for new vans by 2030 (compared to 2021 levels), as well as a 100 percent CO2 emission reduction target for both new cars and vans by 2035.

The proposal is part of the EU's "Fit for 55 package," which aims to reduce greenhouse emissions in the EU by at least 55 percent by the year 2030.

"This agreement will pave the way for the modern and competitive automotive industry in the EU. The world is changing, and we must remain at the forefront of innovation. I believe we can take advantage of this technological transition. The envisaged timeline also makes the goals achievable for car manufacturers," Jozef Síkela, Czech minister of industry and trade, said in a statement.

The proposal comes with a couple of caveats. One clause allows for vehicles running on so-called CO2 neutral fuels; these are fuels which do emit some carbon dioxide during consumption, but were created in such a way that at least as much carbon dioxide was captured during production.

Also, small volume manufacturers (think sports car makers) are exempt from the clause that requires emission reductions from 2030 onwards, though they, too, will have to fully reduce emissions in their cars by the end of 2035.

Not everyone is happy with the proposed pace of changes. Greenpeace EU claims the deadline "falls well short of the EU’s climate commitments and will cost drivers hundreds of billions in fuel in the midst of a spiralling energy crisis."

"The EU is taking the scenic route, and that route ends in disaster. A European 2035 phase-out of fossil fuel-burning cars is not quick enough: new cars with internal combustion engines should be banned by 2028 at the latest," Greenpeace EU transport campaigner Lorelei Limousin said in a statement.

Physical buttons on the iPhone may be a thing of the past.

According to analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, Apple's iPhone 15 Pro, which is likely to arrive in 2023, will have solid-state buttons instead of physical ones.

More precisely, both the power button on the right side and the volume buttons on the left side will become solid-state buttons, albeit, as Kuo claims, only on the two high-end iPhone 15 models.

While "solid-state" might sound arcane, most iPhone and Mac users are already familiar with the design; old iPhone 7 had a solid-state Home button, and newer MacBooks have a trackpad that doubles as a big solid-state button.

Solid-state means there's actually no moving parts in these buttons. They feel like pressable buttons thanks to the magic of Apple's Taptic Engine, wherein a small motor produces vibrations to give the user back haptic feedback as they press the button. According to Kuo, this will mean that the new iPhones will get two additional Taptic Engines, one on the left and one on the right. Current iPhones have one Taptic Engine which provides feedback as you tap on the display.

There's no word on whether these new buttons will look different from the current ones, though.

Kuo also says that "high-end Android smartphones" will also follow Apple's design and adopt solid-state buttons.

Finally, Kuo stated that the switch to USB-C, and the new buttons, are "two of the major updates for iPhone 15." Apple's senior vice president of worldwide marketing, Greg Joswiak, recently confirmed that the company will switch to USB-C on the iPhone in the future, though he wouldn't provide the exact timing.

Other iPhone 15 rumors say that the Pro models will get a new chip, the A17 Bionic, an improved telephoto camera, and up to 8GB RAM memory. The iPhone 15 Pro likely isn't due for another 10 months, so take any rumors and reports with a grain of salt.

Have you ever looked up from your phone, eyes stinging and mind cloudy, realising that hours have passed without your noticing? If this sounds like you, some people on the internet would have a prescription for you: you need to go touch grass.

To be told to touch grass is intended as an insult for people who spend too much time online, disconnected from the reality outside their pixelated screens. Touching grass means stepping away from the infinite scroll of our phones and spending time outside in nature and, well, real life.

Consumers in the UK spend an average of six hours of social media screen time , with people in the U.S. spending around seven hours on their phones. These rates rise with younger consumers. With the news that Elon Musk has officially (for real, this time) acquired Twitter , many people are announcing they're leaving Twitter in protest . As Mashable tech reporter Cecily Mauran argues, "for months, the social media platform has been awash with tweets making this smug threat. As a Person Who Uses the Internet, I'm begging you, please stop. No one cares."

Though touching grass is an internet joke, is it time for us to silently step away and touch grass? Can we take more from the advice to log off? And is it really possible to truly ‘touch grass’?

Time to log off, folks

Paulie, a teacher living in Manchester, initially started going on the internet as a teenager because his friends were on it – connecting with them on old-school networks like Bebo, founded in 2005. Then, as he got older, he started to become fixated by consuming content. He pinpoints that where things started to go wrong were with Twitter. "I was trying to keep up with politics and the news cycle… It made me feel awful watching the news and not being able to stop any of these terrible things from happening. I’d feel doomed." He knew he needed to take a break, so he stopped using social media for two months – he decided to experiment with touching grass.

"In any spare moment, like smoking a cigarette, I noticed I’d take my phone out and just passively stuff would flash past me… It was a way to fill spare time."

Mimi, a communications officer in London, felt she had to detox from social media for other reasons. She deactivated her Instagram account for almost two years, and now remains in a rapid cycle of de- and reactivating it. The main issue she encountered with social media was her passive, addictive use of it. "In any spare moment, like smoking a cigarette, I noticed I’d take my phone out and just passively stuff would flash past me… It was a way to fill spare time, and I realised I didn't need to and that it might be better to have a real rest for five minutes and possibly risk thinking one independent thought." She also began to realise that being online was leaving her in a constant state of dissatisfaction with her life: "These platforms exist to make you more miserable by making you aware of the things you don’t have. You’re perpetually in a state of consumption because you’re just a post away from seeing something and wanting it."

Tom, a data scientist in Manchester, felt Mimi’s mindless scrolling problem spiral out of control with his own internet use. "I get hyperfocused [so it would] often happen that I’d go on YouTube to watch one video and then four or five hours would go by without me realising and I’d sort of come out of this daze." He felt like he’d "wasted all this time and my brain felt really overloaded from all the content." Becoming sick of this pattern and the impact it was having on both his work and his personal life, Tom decided to stop all recreational internet use for a month and a half.

Each of these relationships with social media isn’t surprising to Juulia Karlstedt , a counsellor specialising in anxiety. "There is a growing body of research linking social media use to mental health difficulties like anxiety, depression, poor sleep, self-harm, and loneliness. Because social media is designed to grab our attention and hold it, there are a lot of inbuilt mechanisms in platforms that increase our consumption and, by extension, increase the risks to our mental health associated with high levels of use." With her own clients, she sees this problem particularly arise in people in their teens and 20s.

Karlstedt recommends that if people are feeling the detrimental effects of digital addiction, they should try taking a break. "Take stock of your life outside the platforms and see if there are areas that are meaningful to you that you could engage with offline. Social media's pull on us will always be greater when we don't have a strong anchor grounding us in our life offline."

Life is more enjoyable offline

That’s exactly what Paulie, Mimi, and Tom each tried to do. They all look back fondly on their time away from social media. Though they took different approaches, with Tom taking the most radical approach of avoiding anything he felt gave him a "release of dopamine," Paulie taking time away from Twitter, Instagram and Facebook to quit his doomscrolling and Mimi deleting Instagram to try and win some of her spare time back, they each told me they felt significant benefits from detoxing digitally.

Tom felt an immediate positive effect. "I felt really present and mindful, which I'd never really been before. I had a lot of free time, so I was very productive…I found myself being more present with people… Little things became so much more enjoyable because I wasn't getting the constant onslaught of stimulation and pleasure from digital stuff." Mimi felt her self-esteem improve as she wasn’t constantly comparing herself to people on Instagram stories.

"I had this idea that I’d put the phone down and then I’d be running out the door skipping like it’s spring and I would play the flute and sit under trees reading all day. It wasn’t like that really."

Paulie was a little bit underwhelmed initially. "I think before I gave it up I had this idea that I’d put the phone down and then I’d be running out the door skipping like it’s spring and I would play the flute and sit under trees reading all day. It wasn’t like that really. I was still on edge for the first few weeks just like I had been." However, over the following weeks, he started to see the benefits. "I definitely became more present, I wasn’t constantly taking in content every moment. I was also bored at times but that made me more present as it made me more interested in people in real life and what they had to say. My social anxiety improved, my real relationships improved with people I care about."

In logging off from the online world, Paulie, Tom and Mimi all felt both more and less connected to the ‘real’ world. They each felt more present in their ‘real’ lives, connecting with people on a deeper level. Going offline though, came with some disconnection from real world events. Paulie admits that "I used to talk about serious issues a lot. Then after my detox I was much less serious but to a point where I would not want to hear bad news at all." He’s trying to find a workable solution to this. "I'm trying to find the balance where I’m not constantly feeling awful about the world but where I'm also looped in and happy to talk about serious things and things that are real problems."

"Social media is very good at pulling us into mental tangents, so working with a timer can be helpful to check in with yourself if you've gone down a rabbit hole."

Karlstedt sees that this approach of balance and mindfulness will work well for those who want to stay engaged, or for those who have to use social media for purposes of work. "Social media is very good at pulling us into mental tangents, so working with a timer can be helpful to check in with yourself if you've gone down a rabbit hole. When the timer goes off, ask yourself what you were just consuming online and how you felt while consuming it. If you need to, take a moment to step away from social media and spend a little time off your device. When you're ready, engage mindfully again by setting a focus for yourself and set another time to check in again later."

While each of the detoxers spoke at length about the benefits they felt about detoxing digitally, they each ultimately ended up going back to social media. In the cases of Tom and Mimi, they went into somewhat of a relapse. Incidentally, they were both unwell at their time of this ‘relapse’ – unoccupied in bed, they each reengaged with their renounced apps. Tom, particularly, found himself spiralling. "I ended up pretty much overdosing on YouTube and then I was out of balance and had a really hard time trying to rein it back in again." He ultimately did though, finding his average screen time has decreased by about two hours a day.

They all suggested that they felt they ‘had’ to go back on it in the modern age but they all admitted that they often feel awful when they fall back into their old patterns. "It definitely has a detrimental effect on my life." Mimi acknowledged, mirroring similar thoughts to Paulie and Tom.

However, they’ve all also found balance.Taking a detox allowed each of them space to step back and reassess their addictive, autopilot relationship with social media. Both Tom and Mimi say they’d love to detox again, and hope to at some point soon. Paulie, however, argued that cold turkey wasn’t the way forward for him. "Being addicted to social media didn’t make me happy, but I needed to find balance. Plenty of good things have come from social media for me, so I’d never want to shut it off entirely."

While everyone I spoke to did ultimately return to their online life, it’s obvious that their attempt to ‘touch grass’ successfully showed them that digitally detoxing, even for a short while, had beneficial effects on their mental health. So maybe it’s time to try a period of touching grass – right after finishing this article, which you probably found through Twitter.

Consumers in the UK spend an average of six hours of social media screen time , with people in the U.S. spending around seven hours on their phones. These rates rise with younger consumers. With the news that Elon Musk has officially (for real, this time) acquired Twitter , many people are announcing they're leaving Twitter in protest . As Mashable tech reporter Cecily Mauran argues, "for months, the social media platform has been awash with tweets making this smug threat. As a Person Who Uses the Internet, I'm begging you, please stop. No one cares."

Though touching grass is an internet joke, is it time for us to silently step away and touch grass? Can we take more from the advice to log off? And is it really possible to truly ‘touch grass’?

Time to log off, folks

Paulie, a teacher living in Manchester, initially started going on the internet as a teenager because his friends were on it – connecting with them on old-school networks like Bebo, founded in 2005. Then, as he got older, he started to become fixated by consuming content. He pinpoints that where things started to go wrong were with Twitter. "I was trying to keep up with politics and the news cycle… It made me feel awful watching the news and not being able to stop any of these terrible things from happening. I’d feel doomed." He knew he needed to take a break, so he stopped using social media for two months – he decided to experiment with touching grass.

"In any spare moment, like smoking a cigarette, I noticed I’d take my phone out and just passively stuff would flash past me… It was a way to fill spare time."

Mimi, a communications officer in London, felt she had to detox from social media for other reasons. She deactivated her Instagram account for almost two years, and now remains in a rapid cycle of de- and reactivating it. The main issue she encountered with social media was her passive, addictive use of it. "In any spare moment, like smoking a cigarette, I noticed I’d take my phone out and just passively stuff would flash past me… It was a way to fill spare time, and I realised I didn't need to and that it might be better to have a real rest for five minutes and possibly risk thinking one independent thought." She also began to realise that being online was leaving her in a constant state of dissatisfaction with her life: "These platforms exist to make you more miserable by making you aware of the things you don’t have. You’re perpetually in a state of consumption because you’re just a post away from seeing something and wanting it."

Tom, a data scientist in Manchester, felt Mimi’s mindless scrolling problem spiral out of control with his own internet use. "I get hyperfocused [so it would] often happen that I’d go on YouTube to watch one video and then four or five hours would go by without me realising and I’d sort of come out of this daze." He felt like he’d "wasted all this time and my brain felt really overloaded from all the content." Becoming sick of this pattern and the impact it was having on both his work and his personal life, Tom decided to stop all recreational internet use for a month and a half.

Each of these relationships with social media isn’t surprising to Juulia Karlstedt , a counsellor specialising in anxiety. "There is a growing body of research linking social media use to mental health difficulties like anxiety, depression, poor sleep, self-harm, and loneliness. Because social media is designed to grab our attention and hold it, there are a lot of inbuilt mechanisms in platforms that increase our consumption and, by extension, increase the risks to our mental health associated with high levels of use." With her own clients, she sees this problem particularly arise in people in their teens and 20s.

Karlstedt recommends that if people are feeling the detrimental effects of digital addiction, they should try taking a break. "Take stock of your life outside the platforms and see if there are areas that are meaningful to you that you could engage with offline. Social media's pull on us will always be greater when we don't have a strong anchor grounding us in our life offline."

Life is more enjoyable offline

That’s exactly what Paulie, Mimi, and Tom each tried to do. They all look back fondly on their time away from social media. Though they took different approaches, with Tom taking the most radical approach of avoiding anything he felt gave him a "release of dopamine," Paulie taking time away from Twitter, Instagram and Facebook to quit his doomscrolling and Mimi deleting Instagram to try and win some of her spare time back, they each told me they felt significant benefits from detoxing digitally.

Tom felt an immediate positive effect. "I felt really present and mindful, which I'd never really been before. I had a lot of free time, so I was very productive…I found myself being more present with people… Little things became so much more enjoyable because I wasn't getting the constant onslaught of stimulation and pleasure from digital stuff." Mimi felt her self-esteem improve as she wasn’t constantly comparing herself to people on Instagram stories.

"I had this idea that I’d put the phone down and then I’d be running out the door skipping like it’s spring and I would play the flute and sit under trees reading all day. It wasn’t like that really."

Paulie was a little bit underwhelmed initially. "I think before I gave it up I had this idea that I’d put the phone down and then I’d be running out the door skipping like it’s spring and I would play the flute and sit under trees reading all day. It wasn’t like that really. I was still on edge for the first few weeks just like I had been." However, over the following weeks, he started to see the benefits. "I definitely became more present, I wasn’t constantly taking in content every moment. I was also bored at times but that made me more present as it made me more interested in people in real life and what they had to say. My social anxiety improved, my real relationships improved with people I care about."

In logging off from the online world, Paulie, Tom and Mimi all felt both more and less connected to the ‘real’ world. They each felt more present in their ‘real’ lives, connecting with people on a deeper level. Going offline though, came with some disconnection from real world events. Paulie admits that "I used to talk about serious issues a lot. Then after my detox I was much less serious but to a point where I would not want to hear bad news at all." He’s trying to find a workable solution to this. "I'm trying to find the balance where I’m not constantly feeling awful about the world but where I'm also looped in and happy to talk about serious things and things that are real problems."

"Social media is very good at pulling us into mental tangents, so working with a timer can be helpful to check in with yourself if you've gone down a rabbit hole."

Karlstedt sees that this approach of balance and mindfulness will work well for those who want to stay engaged, or for those who have to use social media for purposes of work. "Social media is very good at pulling us into mental tangents, so working with a timer can be helpful to check in with yourself if you've gone down a rabbit hole. When the timer goes off, ask yourself what you were just consuming online and how you felt while consuming it. If you need to, take a moment to step away from social media and spend a little time off your device. When you're ready, engage mindfully again by setting a focus for yourself and set another time to check in again later."

While each of the detoxers spoke at length about the benefits they felt about detoxing digitally, they each ultimately ended up going back to social media. In the cases of Tom and Mimi, they went into somewhat of a relapse. Incidentally, they were both unwell at their time of this ‘relapse’ – unoccupied in bed, they each reengaged with their renounced apps. Tom, particularly, found himself spiralling. "I ended up pretty much overdosing on YouTube and then I was out of balance and had a really hard time trying to rein it back in again." He ultimately did though, finding his average screen time has decreased by about two hours a day.

They all suggested that they felt they ‘had’ to go back on it in the modern age but they all admitted that they often feel awful when they fall back into their old patterns. "It definitely has a detrimental effect on my life." Mimi acknowledged, mirroring similar thoughts to Paulie and Tom.

However, they’ve all also found balance.Taking a detox allowed each of them space to step back and reassess their addictive, autopilot relationship with social media. Both Tom and Mimi say they’d love to detox again, and hope to at some point soon. Paulie, however, argued that cold turkey wasn’t the way forward for him. "Being addicted to social media didn’t make me happy, but I needed to find balance. Plenty of good things have come from social media for me, so I’d never want to shut it off entirely."

While everyone I spoke to did ultimately return to their online life, it’s obvious that their attempt to ‘touch grass’ successfully showed them that digitally detoxing, even for a short while, had beneficial effects on their mental health. So maybe it’s time to try a period of touching grass – right after finishing this article, which you probably found through Twitter.
Craving a new cooking show that'll get your tastebuds tittering and your mind soothed with savory shots of food porn? You've seen Nailed It, Iron Chef, The Greatest British Baking Show, and plenty of other delectable Netlfix offerings . So, maybe it's time for a cocktail?

Drink Masters is the latest cooking competition show from the streaming giant, and with a collection of creative mixologists, it brings all the oohs, ahs, and awe we thirst for in great reality TV.

Sure, on its surface, this show is about contenders making crazy concoctions to appease a panel of experts in all things spirits and liquor. But beyond the competition, Drink Masters offers audiences all around the world a glimpse into the astonishing showmanship that's going on in some of North America's coolest cocktail lounges. Even if you're a regular visitor to chic speakeasies, your jaw will drop over these cool creations. And if you — like me — are a bit of a home mixologist, this show will provide plenty of inspiration alongside its swooning shots of playful pours.

What's Drink Masters about?

12 mixologists compete for the title of Drink Master and a prize of $100,000. Their arena is a gorgeous bar, with a full kitchen setup, and plenty of posh backdrops that ooze with the atmosphere of a hip but exclusive night spot. In each episode, they will be challenged not only to create a tasty drink but also to stage it in a way that befits such grand surroundings.

Their challenges range from creating dessert drinks to tempting taste pairings, and fantastical flights. But before you think, "I could do that," consider that they're given 90 minutes to make a margarita in episode 1. You know what that means: Going classic or simple will get you 86ed from this competition. As such, the mixologists pull out all the stops, along with smokers, and unconventional ingredients — like the polarizing fruit durian — to make cocktails that are works of sippable art.

The Drink Master judges are heralded bar owners and tastemakers, Julie Reiner and Frankie Solarik, who'll bring in some famous friends to play guest judges for episodes that explore cocktail making's history, highlights, and future. These experts give context to terminology and emerging movements — like the rise in mocktails — so that even those of us who are favoring margaritas in a can over shaking up our own can follow along.

But the MVP of Season 1 is definitely Drink Masters' host Tone Bell.

Cooking shows and comedians can go together like peanut butter and jelly. What would Nailed It be without Nicole Byers' contagious laughter and playful repartee with judges and bakers alike? But for every Byers, I can name two to three comedians who seem to begrudge the job of pairing silliness with sweets. (Looking at you Is It Cake's Mikey Day, Crime Scene Kitchen's Joel McHale, and Great British Baking Show 's Matt Lucas.) When a comedian serves up snark as a side dish to the earnest efforts of contestants, it can leave us with a bad taste in our mouths. But Bell is absolutely delighted to be there, and so is a delight himself!

In the show's opening, he not only lays down the premise of the new competition series, but also notes, "And of course, I get to sample these amazing creations and give my own two cents." With this brief moment, Drink Masters sets up that Bell won't be here to crack wise and caper. He'll bring verve and his opinion to the judges' panel. In this way, the show aligns him with the contestants, because their failure means his suffering an unsavory drink. But it also makes him our audience surrogate, an everyman of sorts, who gets to taste these curious cocktails and then tell us in terms we readily understand how they turned out. From the jump, Bell is our guide into this heady world of highfalutin mixology, inviting us in with a smile, a to-die-for sense of style, and a welcoming sense of humor.

Let's talk about that style. Bedecked in bespoke suits that often burst with eye-catching color, Bell is a dashing gentleman as he escorts us through the challenges. He's invariably dressed like he's stepping out to a hot spot to see and be seen, and so he gives elegance, exuberance, and visual splendor to each ep. But beyond the eye candy of a handsome man in a hot suit, Bell has a party-friendly persona that easily encourages the judges and mixologists to converse with him about life and cocktails. And in exchange, he shares insights that are unique and fun.

For instance, in the first challenge, a contestant set down a cocktail she called "The Fellowship," in a clear nod to The Lord of the Rings. Bell lifted the glass stein the beautiful beverage was presented in, and proclaimed, "I love this glass. I love this whole presentation because it makes me feel like I'm going to a happy hour in Narnia. You know what I mean?"

The other judges and the guest chuckled in appreciation, and so did I because I knew exactly what he meant. Succinctly, Bell brought us into the experience of being transported by a truly splendid cocktail. And from that point, I knew I wasn't going to be able to stop at just one (episode of Drink Masters).

Drink Masters is collaborative and competitive in a great-watch way.

Personally, my favorite competition shows are the ones where the contenders treat each other with compassion, recognizing they are part of a shared community. (Think Face Off, Making It, or Forged in Fire.) I've grown weary of the "I didn't come here to make friends" drama. I yearn for competitors whose strategy is never to sabotage but to overcome their inner saboteur.

Now, I can't promise every mixologist in Drink Masters is endlessly operating out of a communal concern. But it helps that team challenges inherently include drama and the need for actual compromise and collaboration. However, I was touched to see how they aid each other, check in on each other, and cry for each other when someone is sent home after each elimination challenge.

While I won't spoil who makes it to the final three, I will say it was a heartwarming thrill to see the contestants — even in this last grasp for a fortune — help each other out. Because of course when the reality TV ends, you're back to reality. And these mixologists can come out of their speakeasy stadium the hero or the villain, even if they're not the winner. While a certain bar owner soured for me over the course of the competition — making snippy comments about milk punches always winning only to turn around and make a milk punch in the following ep! — no one here gets a damning "villain edit." And as such, there's tension but never an off-putting taint to the show's creativity-wins vibe.

It's almost a comedic cliche that in cooking shows, competitors from Chopped to GBBO to Kitchen Nightmares justify their dishes with a backstory meant to enhance the experience. In Drink Masters, if you made a drinking contest out of taking a shot every time someone cited their grandmothers as a taste inspiration, you'd be in trouble in a binge-watch! Playing to the sympathy of the judges is part of the game, of course. But Drink Masters probes beyond this treacly territory to radiant self-expression.

Montreal-based mixologist Tao Zrafi expresses his world travels through his cocktails, while Bronx-raised LP took the judges on a journey to her hometown with a drink and plantain pairing meant to recall her snack-seeking trips to the corner bodega. Others reflect their heritage with new spins on classic cocktails, while still others throw every idea at the glass to see what sticks, like swipes of chocolate, a pineapple bird, and edible gold.

Over the course of 10 episodes, Drink Masters offers viewers a crash course on cocktail culture. And at thirty-something minutes an ep, the first season flies by with fiery challenges, charming quips from its charismatic host, compelling contestants, and drool-inducing cocktails. So, if you're looking for a new show to cozy up with, might we suggest pairing this stunner with whatever beverage you can mix up.

Everyone loves a good monster. They feed into our cultural zeitgeist on a daily basis: Whether it’s the wave of Jean Jacket TikToks that had everyone double-taking at the sky, or the Babadook becoming an unprecedented gay icon, we love creepy creatures. We love making memes out of them. We love dressing up as them. We willingly sit through two-hour films for the slightest glimpse of them. And Guillermo del Toro’s Cabinet of Curiosities is a whole feast of marvelous monsters satisfying all of that hunger.

But how do you make a monster? While del Toro’s reputation as a creature king precedes him, Cabinet of Curiosities is an entirely new feat with eight separate, totally unique creatures starring in each episode. Some will haunt you at night, and some will leave you awestruck at their complete originality. So if you’ve found yourself googling octopus lore after Cabinet of Curiosities’ first episode, thank the show’s brilliant lead designer and prosthetics expert Mike Hill — a close collaborator of del Toro’s for over 10 years and the monster maker behind many residents of his creature canon.

Making a monster (literally)

"Dreams in the Witch House"s leading lady was one of Hill's many designs for the show. Credit: Ken Woroner/Netflix

“We try to stay away from the Hollywood fabrication type of things that look like [they’ve] been Hollywood created," said Hill in an interview with Mashable. "We try to make something that’s of this planet, of this earth… You should be able to walk past these things in a zoo, and look in and think oh, it’s a marine animal, and never think oh, what the hell is that."

While we’ve often seen feature films going to extreme lengths to create extraterrestrial entities or amalgams of things completely alien to us, we’ve also seen an arguably more successful track record of creatures inspired by all the weird stuff going on on earth. Whether it’s Stranger Things’ Mind-Flayer amping up spiders by a thousand, or Jean Jacket echoing obscure jellyfish lurking in the deepest parts of our ocean, taking something that we recognise and morphing it into something that we don’t is an approach to horror design that’s significantly scarier because it’s so close to home. And that’s exactly what Hill and his team do for every creature in Cabinet of Curiosities.

"After my initial conversations with Guillermo and Guy Davis, our job is to take those notes and concepts and turn [them] into something real, into something plausible," said Hill. It's a job that’s all too much like a quest, with Hill and his team relying on troves of real-life footage, including mummified bodies and war-induced physical trauma, to get a sense of what a flayed, starved demon could realistically look like.

The quest then spans into figuring out the materials to create the creature. “The greatest marriage is VFX and practical effects,” explains Hill. In the pursuit of making their Dottie, the hellish tentacled nightmare in the show’s first episode, Hill explains that while VFX worked to produce the tentacles sprawling out of her, the rest of Dottie was pure SFX. The many steps included body casting actors, turning that into fiberglass, then using clay to sculpt extra bits needed for the creature, molding all of the above into a latex suit, and then doing an external paint job to make it look all the more real. A tedious, yet incredibly, rewarding SFX process that’s been a recipe for all our favorite monsters from Dottie all the way to the Night King.

“If a movie’s called Count Dracula, he’s got to be good because that’s all the audience is waiting for," said Hill. "You can have your A-list actors and magnificent sets, but at the end of the day, people are waiting for that creature. If that creature doesn’t work, your movie’s lost, the audience is lost.”

The stakes are abundantly clear when making a creature feature, but while visual concepts and effects take up 50% of its creation, the other 50% rests in its personification — in making a character out of a creature. It’s easy to make something scary, but to build something that’s scheming, primitive, and constantly hunting, is a mammoth task that transcends a creature’s terror beyond a fleeting jump-scare.

The line between that is seeing creatures as characters and not as deluded monsters. “You really need to make these things seem like undeniably living creatures with a personality and with a soul,” explains Hill. “[del Toro and I] see them as everyday characters who just happen to have no face.” del Toro and Hill’s love of characters like Frankenstein’s creature informs a process that values building a personality for their antagonists as much as their appearance. Why we remember the duo’s creatures, with the extensive list including the iconic Amphibian Man from The Shape of Water, is because there’s a story behind them. Dottie in “Lot 36” is a scorned woman whose revenge plays in tandem with the demon living inside her. The witch in “Pickman’s Model” is intrinsically “evil for evil’s sake,” admitted Hill. All these characters have motives which are entirely unbound and act in entirely unpredictable ways. That’s what makes them so good time and time again.

“Everyone loves creatures and monsters," Hill said simply. "The whole world loves them… They love witches, they love monsters, they love the dark. Monsters are actually loved and not hated, which is ironic.” In 2022 alone our Twitter feeds have been blessed with Vecna memes, Targaryen dragons, alien sightings, and Barbarian’s mother character all at once. Cabinet of Curiosities is ready to add even more colorful creatures to the horde.

We often overlook the monster makers who spend months on end perfecting every detail of what later becomes all of our Halloween costumes — a shame considering the meticulousness of the craft. Everything can be a monster, but not everyone can do a monster right. In Cabinet of Curiosities, Hill and his wonderful crew elevate the show with each second of their creature creations. And I can’t wait to see all the Dottie cosplays to come.

The quest then spans into figuring out the materials to create the creature. “The greatest marriage is VFX and practical effects,” explains Hill. In the pursuit of making their Dottie, the hellish tentacled nightmare in the show’s first episode, Hill explains that while VFX worked to produce the tentacles sprawling out of her, the rest of Dottie was pure SFX. The many steps included body casting actors, turning that into fiberglass, then using clay to sculpt extra bits needed for the creature, molding all of the above into a latex suit, and then doing an external paint job to make it look all the more real. A tedious, yet incredibly, rewarding SFX process that’s been a recipe for all our favorite monsters from Dottie all the way to the Night King.

“If a movie’s called Count Dracula, he’s got to be good because that’s all the audience is waiting for," said Hill. "You can have your A-list actors and magnificent sets, but at the end of the day, people are waiting for that creature. If that creature doesn’t work, your movie’s lost, the audience is lost.”

The stakes are abundantly clear when making a creature feature, but while visual concepts and effects take up 50% of its creation, the other 50% rests in its personification — in making a character out of a creature. It’s easy to make something scary, but to build something that’s scheming, primitive, and constantly hunting, is a mammoth task that transcends a creature’s terror beyond a fleeting jump-scare.

The line between that is seeing creatures as characters and not as deluded monsters. “You really need to make these things seem like undeniably living creatures with a personality and with a soul,” explains Hill. “[del Toro and I] see them as everyday characters who just happen to have no face.” del Toro and Hill’s love of characters like Frankenstein’s creature informs a process that values building a personality for their antagonists as much as their appearance. Why we remember the duo’s creatures, with the extensive list including the iconic Amphibian Man from The Shape of Water, is because there’s a story behind them. Dottie in “Lot 36” is a scorned woman whose revenge plays in tandem with the demon living inside her. The witch in “Pickman’s Model” is intrinsically “evil for evil’s sake,” admitted Hill. All these characters have motives which are entirely unbound and act in entirely unpredictable ways. That’s what makes them so good time and time again.

“Everyone loves creatures and monsters," Hill said simply. "The whole world loves them… They love witches, they love monsters, they love the dark. Monsters are actually loved and not hated, which is ironic.” In 2022 alone our Twitter feeds have been blessed with Vecna memes, Targaryen dragons, alien sightings, and Barbarian’s mother character all at once. Cabinet of Curiosities is ready to add even more colorful creatures to the horde.

We often overlook the monster makers who spend months on end perfecting every detail of what later becomes all of our Halloween costumes — a shame considering the meticulousness of the craft. Everything can be a monster, but not everyone can do a monster right. In Cabinet of Curiosities, Hill and his wonderful crew elevate the show with each second of their creature creations. And I can’t wait to see all the Dottie cosplays to come.
If you think you’ve cracked every detail in Wendell & Wild, think again. To all spooky stop-motion enthusiasts, you’ll be delighted to know that tacked on to the film’s almost two-hour runtime is a sneaky post-credit scene with our favorite character.

Following the trials and tribulations of a young hell maiden, Wendell & Wild introduces us to Kat Elliot (Lyric Ross) a teenage, demon-summoning badass who’s on a mission to save her parents and her town with two gloriously chaotic demon brothers, Wendell (Keegan-Michael Key) and Wild (Jordan Peele), by her side. The film’s eerily fantastical adventure is beautifully animated through director Henry Selick’s speciality, stop-motion, and its end (and post) credits are all just one giant love letter to the timeless craft.

Starting off with concept art, Wendell & Wild’s end credits take us through the film’s animation process. From sneak peeks of initial character designs, all the way to behind-the-scenes footage of building the film’s puppets (they’re huge). But the film’s post-credits scene is perhaps the true cherry on top of all that animation adoration. The short, but splendid, scene sees an animator at home waking up in the middle of night because of some ruckus. He gets up to explore his makeshift at-home studio, only to find our favorite Kat snooping around our very own Land of the Living.

Her little peek-a-boo is the cutest thing ever and will be sure to delight the film’s younger audiences, but is also a touching tribute to the relentless work of their animation team. It’s an ode to how much time they spent working on the film while adapting to the pandemic’s at-home requirements — and the unique impact of stop-motion animation in breathing a type of life into characters that other mediums within the field simply can’t.

Stop-motion is a painstaking process, and filming a realistic stop-motion scene through an iPhone is even more tedious, and yet the dedicated creators behind Wendell & Wild still gave us this sweet stinger to inject even more realism into the lovable Kat. Who knows what hellish havoc she’ll get up to in our world.

Some movies are less than their best intentions. It’s difficult to fully parse writer/director James Gray’s white guilt manifesto Armageddon Time, his follow-up to his sad-dad opus Ad Astra , without falling under its well-meaning spell. But we’ve seen this movie before, the one where a white person learns about racism to the detriment of their Black counterpart. In this case, the familiar narrative takes place in 1980, in a corner of Gray’s childhood neighborhood in Queens. Serving as Gray’s autobiographical stand-in is Paul Graff (Banks Repeta), a petulant, artistically misunderstood Jewish kid navigating the uneasy racial politics of his household.

The film begins with Paul sketching a picture of his draconian sixth-grade teacher Mr. Turkeltaub (Andrew Polk) as a half-man, half-turkey. Paul proudly passes the lampoonish cartoon to his snickering classmates, in the process, inviting the wrath of his teacher. "You think this is appropriate?" asks Mr. Turkeltaub. "I just wanted to make everyone laugh," a meek Paul responds.

During this grilling, the only person who sticks up for Paul is Johnny Davis (Jaylin Webb), a Black kid repeating this grade. As punishment, both boys are relegated to washing the blackboard. Behind his teacher’s back, Paul does a disco move to the appreciation of his classmates. At their outburst of giggles, the instructor doesn’t chastise Paul; he blames Johnny. This will not be the only time Johnny feels the consequences of Paul’s shortsighted actions. The bulk of the film, however, uses their hijinks as the backdrop to Paul’s troubled family life, helmed by his mother Esther (Anne Hathaway), his father Irving (Jeremy Strong), and the anti-Black opinions that thrum through their politically moderate Jewish household.

Armageddon Time finds a surprising stability in Paul’s home despite his family's toxic dynamic. The opening dinner scene aptly depicts the family’s dysfunction, with a bullying older brother and an authoritative father who is often abusive. Strong plays the volcanic dad with a potent, brutal touch. Paul’s mother, who serves as the head of the Parent Teacher Association, often succumbs to her young son’s charm. When Paul opts to order dumplings after insulting her homemade food, her commands for Paul to put down the phone are for naught. He calls anyway.

The calm center of the family is Paul’s impish yet morally resolute grandfather Aaron Rabinowitz (Anthony Hopkins). By offering sage advice, Aaron often calms his grandson’s ill temper. Hopkins gives a physically delicate performance, built upon caved-in postures and a shuffling walk. But unlike the naturalistic Hathaway, who deftly immerses herself in the large ensemble, his star power overwhelms the frame more than Gray might desire. Paul is a reflection of these adults: He idolizes his grandfather, evangelizes his mother, and shies away from his father.

To Gray’s credit, he does comprehend the tenuous proximity white Jewish people in America have sometimes occupied in relation to white supremacy. We see how casually Paul’s family dispenses with bigoted quips. And it’s brought into greater focus after Paul is caught in the boys bathroom smoking weed with Johnny.

His alarmed parents hurriedly transfer him to his brother’s affluent private school where the likes of Fred Trump (John Diehl) and his daughter Maryanne Trump (Jessica Chastain) serve as donors/mentors, espousing bootstrapping talking points to the kids. It’s all part of the Graff family’s partial assimilation into white American society, one that required they change their name to avoid antisemitism and asks them to essentially pass. For the Graffs, this is a form of self-preservation.

The film, in fact, is accidentally a metaphor for how little politically moderate white folks, in general, have actually reckoned with their part in the contemporary anti-Black rise of Trumpian rhetoric.

Through Paul’s impressionable eyes, Gray documents the varied ways Paul’s family tacitly supports white supremacy. We see the anti-Black slurs, from both his family and outsiders, that Paul chooses to ignore. We witness how his white entitlement allows him to sidestep punishment. We observe how often he brazenly brags about his white privilege by boasting to Johnny about his family’s wealth. However, in one scene, Paul’s grandfather implores him to speak up for the people of color around him, saying, "You’re going to be a mensch... They never had your advantages."

In Repeta’s measured performance you can sense the challenges a young Gray must have confronted. In Paul’s every capitulation to his bigoted classmates, Repeta externalizes the complex moral battlefield raging within the character. It’s a tender performance trapped in a politically wayward movie.

This supposedly morally complex story, partly based on Gray’s childhood, lacks bite, lacks true introspective, and lacks any notion resembling interest in aesthetically and narratively humanizing its injured party: the lone Black character, Johnny. The film, in fact, is accidentally a metaphor for how little politically moderate white folks, in general, have actually reckoned with their part in the contemporary anti-Black rise of Trumpian rhetoric.

Armageddon Time aims to show that anti-Blackness and antisemitism are equally terrible (in the larger world, Black Jews feel the brunt of both). Kanye West’s recent espousing of antisemitic Trumpian rhetoric has also reminded the American public of that very real fact. By wielding Johnny as an undefined tool, Gray, unfortunately, only addresses one in any meaningful way.

Gray succeeds at interrogating how the wake of historical antisemitism can lead a family like the Graffs to align with white oppressors through assimilation and capitulation in name of self-preservation, or in the words of Paul’s grandmother, to "get a seat at the table." But in processing his own guilt, Gray succumbs to oppressing Johnny by erasing his personhood from the film, thereby unwittingly causing Black audiences to feel as unseen as Johnny does.

Armageddon Time is Hollywood failing with race again.

Credit: Anne Joyce / Focus Features



Hollywood often fails at rendering the inner lives of politically flawed white folks, primarily because these learning experiences often come at the behest of Black sacrifice. Films like Green Book , Driving Miss Daisy, and The Green Mile — all movies that also received widespread praise from white critics — similarly feature bare-bones Black characters with just enough personhood to not only illuminate the white character’s struggle but also to provide partial grounding for the Black character’s inevitable, nonsensical self-sacrifice.

In his essay collection The Devil Finds Work, James Baldwin writes about the sparse setup 1958's The Defiant Ones provides for why Noah (Sidney Poitier) falls from the train for the sake of John (Tony Curtis), a racist man he hated nearly an hour before. The film operates under the belief that Black people inherently know their white counterpart’s life holds greater value than their own. For its own part, Armageddon Time provides so few reasons for why Paul and Johnny are friends; why at every point Johnny takes the fall for Paul; why Johnny implicitly goes along with Paul’s schemes. The only spark for their friendship — other than their role as class clowns — is Paul’s invitation to Johnny to sleep in his clubhouse, which is just a shed in his backyard. Johnny is unaware of the precariousness of his safety in proximity to white people to unbelievable levels, even for a kid.

Through Paul’s narrow vantage point, Gray often narratively shortchanges Johnny with broad character beats: He loves the Sugar Hill Gang; he wants to become an astronaut in Florida; his grandmother is battling dementia. We never see Johnny’s much-talked-about stepbrother. We barely glimpse his grandmother. (In the film’s other scenes, Webb performs some exceptional heavy lifting to imbue this character with a modicum of personhood). Paul’s myopia is, of course, by design: The scarce interest he takes in the personal life of his best friend illuminates his nauseating self-interest. That insularity, however, shouldn’t spill over to Gray’s gaze or his writing.

Gray has made a film about a white Jewish kid learning a startling lesson concerning his own entitlement. And yet, his film perpetuates those same power dynamics by he and cinematographer Darius Khondji (Bardo) utilizing privileged lighting. Paul’s pale complexion and ginger hair glow in the warm autumnal sun; conversely, Johnny’s skin is zapped of all vibrancy and radiance, whittling down his personhood.

Compare Johnny’s scenes to Brian Tyree Henry in If Beale Street Could Talk — the two actors share a similar complexion — and you can see the difference between a director who prioritizes the luminous quality of Black skin and one who doesn’t. In White Screens/Black Images: Hollywood from the Dark Side, James A. Snead’s observation about representation, when applied to lighting, hits with equal devastation: "the portrayal of blacks in American cinema has been testimony to the fact that ‘what we don’t see’ and ‘what they don’t see’ hurts us — precisely because we are what we don’t see."

Armageddon Time is another version of The Defiant Ones.

There are other failures in the film: The comfortable camera movements, which easily glide, snaking us through the Graff family’s interpersonal relationship, are equally reduced to mawkish, manipulative ends when the same technique is employed in a scene where Paul flees from police. (The set-up of Hopkins’ final monologue is also sentimentalized drivel). Khondji’s distant framing and the editing by Scott Morris of the climactic sequence of Paul and Johnny’s downfall are similarly calculated to the nauseating effect of us experiencing the panic endured by Paul, rather than the emotions felt by Johnny.

Gray, to his credit, understands that Paul’s remorse — displayed during a later heart-to-heart with his dad — is a privilege. He gets another opportunity for self-growth, to learn from his mistakes. But is his regret on the same level as Johnny’s life-altering predicament? Should a white audience be given the opportunity to empathize with Paul through the pain felt by Johnny?

You can’t help but recall Baldwin’s thoughts on The Defiant Ones. "[Poitier] jumps off the train in order to reassure white people, to make them know that they are not hated; that, though they have made human errors, they have done nothing for which to be hated," explained Baldwin. "The reassurance is false, the need is ignoble..."

Toward the end of Armageddon Time, there is an image that underscores the narrowness its white gaze never fully faces. Paul’s parents watch in stunned disbelief as Ronald Reagan wins the presidency. There is little doubt that Paul’s mother and father do not see themselves as racist, precisely because they do not support Reagan. Because of the Trump family scenes that connect their rhetoric to Reagan's, this election night moment serves as a parallel to the white, self-involved moderates who vocally defined themselves as not-Donald-Trump supporters.

Finally, at the school dance, Paul defiantly walks out when Fred Trump addresses the student body. Is his departure meant to be a rejection of his parents’ desired assimilation? Or is Paul actually defining himself as not a Trumpian stooge? The hurried needle drop of The Clash's "Armageddon Time" suggests the former. The film’s aesthetic politics portends the latter.

With Armageddon Time, Gray, like so many other white folks since 2020, misses the opportunity to fully process his guilt in a way that isn’t self-indulgent. While it also wrestles with antisemitism and Jewish identities, the film too often caters to well-meaning white folks looking to balm their wounds by merely acknowledging their privilege. Despite its desires, Armageddon Time is a bundle of empty, over-calibrated gestures — gestures unlikely to signal to Black viewers that white people, in a post-Trump presidency, finally get it.

Armageddon Time opens in select theaters on Oct. 28 and in theaters everywhere Nov. 4.

Earlier this year, we highlighted Resurrection as a standout at the Sundance Film Festival. Now, writer/director Andrew Semans's riveting psychological thriller is coming to theaters and VOD. So, what better time to dig deep into the belly of this shocking horror movie's mind-bending finale? If you walked away from this one with your brain sputtering and your jaw dropped, you aren't alone. Let's break down what it all means.

Resurrection delivers a ruthless tale of domestic abuse and psychological trauma.

Credit: IFC Midnight

Rebecca Hall stars as Margaret, a successful executive whose life seems as perfectly in order as her meticulously pressed business attire. Her home is a chic and tidy apartment, which she shares with her trusting 18-year-old daughter, Abbie (Grace Kaufman). Even her love life is carefully compartmentalized, as she's found a reliable fuck buddy in Peter, an emotionally unavailable co-worker played by Michael Esper. All this is threatened when the past she left behind comes crashing into her present.

David (Tim Roth) is a gruffly handsome 60-year-old British man whose abrupt presence in the fringes of Margaret's life becomes hotly hard to bare. Why, exactly, the sight of David begins to fracture her façade is a secret she'll keep from her daughter, her lover, and even the police. It's a story of domestic abuse, suffocating control, and cannibalistic murder. Who would believe her?

According to a gruesome monologue, Margaret was once in love with an older man whose fawning was all she desired, even when it came at the cost of "kindnesses" that could range from housework to humiliation, subjugation, and self-harm. To prove her devotion to David, she was put into stress positions, burned with cigarettes, and pressured to make him her whole world. Then came her son Ben, a source of joy for her but jealousy for David. To keep Margaret close, David does the unthinkable, the impossible: He eats their baby. However, then — and now, 22 years later, after he resurfaces — he insists the boy lives within him, still crying for his mother, who’d eventually run when she finally believed Ben was dead.

Over a cup of tea, David coolly tries to re-exert control over Margaret by insisting, "He’s still inside me here. Suffering." As the resurrected trauma and stress over keeping her teen daughter safe mounts, Margaret begins to fear this uncanny claim is true, and that her son, who she thought dead for over 20 years, is still an infant, still somehow nestled in his father's guts. She can hear him crying. She can even feel him kick. And then, in the climactic confrontation, she plunges her hands into David's belly, which she's ripped open with a knife, and finds Ben there, breathing. “It’s good to see you again,” she coos. “I saved you.” But what does it mean?

Was David telling the truth? Has Margaret been driven to delusion by his resurfaced abuses? Let's consider the possibilities.

Baby Ben is real and alive.

Logic tells us this can't be true. People can't gobble up babies and store them away for decades, no matter how fueled by spite. However, horror movies can be slippery with their realities. And while Resurrection begins grounded in reality, Semans's script steadily leads us down a dark path of the improbable. Here, a tooth is found in a girl's wallet. There, a baby's burned body appears in an oven — though that was a nightmare of Margaret's... Right?

Logic is not the justification for the theory that Ben is alive. Instead, consider this revelation through the lens of Semans's exploration of domestic violence. David exhibits numerous familiar characteristics of real-life abusers: He charms Margaret's family but makes her feel isolated, dependent on him, and like her whole worth is connected to his pleasure. After Ben is eaten, David even uses his gruesome custody of the infant as a new way to exert control over her, telling her she must bestow upon him "kindnesses" to be near his boy-bearing belly.

Then, there's the awful reality of what can happen when a victim reports abuse: cops who don't help, family who doesn't understand, a story too horrid to be readily believed. Margaret experiences all of this while trying to maintain her grip on the life that she's built out of David's shadow. Hers is an extreme example because of the cannibalism element, but this extremeness is paid off by the finale, where her version of a happy ending isn't just killing her abuser but also recovering the life lost.

Resurrection is a story of a woman undone by an abusive man whose very presence is a threat because of all she knows that has come before. No one understands her pain or her past, and the guilt of leaving her son — even if he was devoured and dead — is threatening her grip on reality. Abbie and Peter even put together an awkward intervention, begging Margaret to get psychological help. Are they right? Is this all in her head? Is she being gaslit by her stalking abuser?

Over the course of the film, Margaret's breakdown is charted visually through her appearance. Her clothes go from coolly elegant to wrinkled and ill-fitting. Her hair grows unkempt. Her skin shifts from radiant to ravaged. Some of this is under the direction of David, who demands she walk to work barefoot, concrete and city streets be damned.

On top of this, Margaret's boundaries are crumbling. Her firm but tender directions to her daughter become tense and tyrannical, demanding the girl never leave their home, ever. She's been absent for work for a week. Her appointments for sex with always-reliable Peter become clumsy hook-ups in a bathroom stall, spilling over into his turning up in her life on a personal level she has no interest in. She lashes out at her eager intern, and — most notably — she plots to kill the man who haunts her waking nightmares. In this scenario, by the time David and Margaret meet in that hotel room, perhaps everything after her gutting him is a delusion of what she needs to be true. She needs to be able to salvage this mess and be the champion to her children that she — and David — insists she is. And we, her witnesses, see the world as she does.

What does Resurrection's ending mean?

Let's look at the final shot through each of these possibilities. In each case, there is a brief possibility of a happy ending, because real or not, Margaret feels the weight of her breathing baby in her arms, reunited, restored, resurrected. But that's not the end of the movie.

The final sequence ushers us back to her and Abbie's apartment, where the girl's room is pristine white, its walls a bit bare as she calmly prepares to go off to college. The panic that wreaked havoc on their relationship is gone. Both women glow as Abbie visits her mother's bedroom, where Margaret sits smiling, holding her swaddled son. After sweetly thanking her mother, Abbie takes the baby from her mother, coos to him, and accepts him. They are the family that Margaret dreamed of. "I'm not scared anymore," Abbie assures Margaret. "You made everything okay, so I'm not scared." But before the film fades to black, Margaret's warm gaze shifts from her children to a mysterious mid-distance. Slowly, her smile wanes. Her eyes' glisten goes cold, a dread creeping in, subtly but unmistakably. She gasps. Then the movie ends.

What does she see? What has she realized? If you read the climax as a delusion, then what does the shrinking smile and haunted stare mean? Notably, in this shot, the focus of the camera shifts, robbing Margaret of her glowy skin, exposing her pores and sweat and teeny imperfections. Is this a clue that Margaret, who no longer has a baby in her arms, is awakening to reality, and it's a horror she can do nothing but stare down?

Alternately, if you view Baby Ben as real and alive, this ending translates to a harrowing terror. Even though David is gone, even though her children are safe, Margaret's trauma lingers. That gasp may mean that Margaret can never truly escape David, because if her baby could have survived being eaten, couldn't David survive being gutted? Perhaps she's looking at him. Perhaps she's staring down the uncertainty that will be her lifelong companion, never truly allowing her to feel safe.

Whichever way you read it, Resurrection delivers a final sequence ripe with savage surprises, then concludes with a final moment that's breathtakingly haunting.

Earlier this year, we highlighted Resurrection as a standout at the Sundance Film Festival. Now, writer/director Andrew Semans's riveting psychological thriller is coming to theaters and VOD. So, what better time to dig deep into the belly of this shocking horror movie's mind-bending finale? If you walked away from this one with your brain sputtering and your jaw dropped, you aren't alone. Let's break down what it all means.

Resurrection delivers a ruthless tale of domestic abuse and psychological trauma.

Credit: IFC Midnight

Rebecca Hall stars as Margaret, a successful executive whose life seems as perfectly in order as her meticulously pressed business attire. Her home is a chic and tidy apartment, which she shares with her trusting 18-year-old daughter, Abbie (Grace Kaufman). Even her love life is carefully compartmentalized, as she's found a reliable fuck buddy in Peter, an emotionally unavailable co-worker played by Michael Esper. All this is threatened when the past she left behind comes crashing into her present.

David (Tim Roth) is a gruffly handsome 60-year-old British man whose abrupt presence in the fringes of Margaret's life becomes hotly hard to bare. Why, exactly, the sight of David begins to fracture her façade is a secret she'll keep from her daughter, her lover, and even the police. It's a story of domestic abuse, suffocating control, and cannibalistic murder. Who would believe her?

According to a gruesome monologue, Margaret was once in love with an older man whose fawning was all she desired, even when it came at the cost of "kindnesses" that could range from housework to humiliation, subjugation, and self-harm. To prove her devotion to David, she was put into stress positions, burned with cigarettes, and pressured to make him her whole world. Then came her son Ben, a source of joy for her but jealousy for David. To keep Margaret close, David does the unthinkable, the impossible: He eats their baby. However, then — and now, 22 years later, after he resurfaces — he insists the boy lives within him, still crying for his mother, who’d eventually run when she finally believed Ben was dead.

Over a cup of tea, David coolly tries to re-exert control over Margaret by insisting, "He’s still inside me here. Suffering." As the resurrected trauma and stress over keeping her teen daughter safe mounts, Margaret begins to fear this uncanny claim is true, and that her son, who she thought dead for over 20 years, is still an infant, still somehow nestled in his father's guts. She can hear him crying. She can even feel him kick. And then, in the climactic confrontation, she plunges her hands into David's belly, which she's ripped open with a knife, and finds Ben there, breathing. “It’s good to see you again,” she coos. “I saved you.” But what does it mean?

Was David telling the truth? Has Margaret been driven to delusion by his resurfaced abuses? Let's consider the possibilities.

Baby Ben is real and alive.

Logic tells us this can't be true. People can't gobble up babies and store them away for decades, no matter how fueled by spite. However, horror movies can be slippery with their realities. And while Resurrection begins grounded in reality, Semans's script steadily leads us down a dark path of the improbable. Here, a tooth is found in a girl's wallet. There, a baby's burned body appears in an oven — though that was a nightmare of Margaret's... Right?

Logic is not the justification for the theory that Ben is alive. Instead, consider this revelation through the lens of Semans's exploration of domestic violence. David exhibits numerous familiar characteristics of real-life abusers: He charms Margaret's family but makes her feel isolated, dependent on him, and like her whole worth is connected to his pleasure. After Ben is eaten, David even uses his gruesome custody of the infant as a new way to exert control over her, telling her she must bestow upon him "kindnesses" to be near his boy-bearing belly.

Then, there's the awful reality of what can happen when a victim reports abuse: cops who don't help, family who doesn't understand, a story too horrid to be readily believed.

Elon Musk officially acquired Twitter today for $44 billion — then promptly fired several executives as soon as he stepped in the door. Between his relatively relaxed attitude toward content moderation and his assertions that up to 75 percent of Twitter's workforce will be cut, the reign of Musk is likely to bring numerous changes to the microblogging platform.

Understandably, not all of them will be welcome.

Twitter's denizens had been apprehensively watching Musk's looming approach for months, some no doubt hoping the deal wouldn't end up going through. Now that it has, the reactions are pouring in.

Some users are suggesting everyone abandon Twitter for the greener pastures of LinkedIn or literally anywhere else. Others are proposing they stay and deliberately tank the website's value, much like Tumblr after Yahoo acquired it in 2013. Meanwhile, those celebrating Musk's takeover are taking full advantage of his promises of less discerning moderation by tweeting a whole bunch of slurs. This helps explain the first two reactions.

As Musk acknowledged in a recent open letter to advertisers, letting Twitter become a "free-for-all hellscape" would not be ideal. Socially, such a result could have a devastating impact on matters like democracy and health education. At the very least it would put off some advertisers, which is probably more important to Musk considering advertising is Twitter's primary source of revenue.

Yet despite this, Musk's statements have clearly emboldened some edgelords of the internet who believe he is their champion in their fight to post racist tweets without consequences.

And, of course, exactly what constitutes a "hellscape" is extremely subjective.

Friday is here at last. But someone doesn't realize they're supposed to take it easy today, and that person's name is Qurodle (OK Quordle is not a person, but pretend).

If Quordle is a little too challenging today, you've come to the right place for hints. There aren't just hints here, but the whole Quordle solution. Scroll to the bottom of this page, and there it is. But are you sure you need all four answers? Maybe you just need a strategy guide. Either way, scroll down, and you'll get what you need.

What is Quordle?

Quordle is a five-letter word guessing game similar to Wordle, except each guess applies letters to four words at the same time. You get nine guesses instead of six to correctly guess all four words. It looks like playing four Wordle games at the same time, and that is essentially what it is. But it's not nearly as intimidating as it sounds.

Is Quordle harder than Wordle?

Yes, though not diabolically so.

Where did Quordle come from?

Amid the Wordle boom of late 2021 and early 2022, when everyone was learning to love free, in-browser, once-a-day word guessing games, creator Freddie Meyer says he took inspiration from one of the first big Wordle variations, Dordle — the one where you essentially play two Wordles at once. He took things up a notch, and released Quordle on January 30. Meyer's creation was covered in The Guardian six days later, and now, according to Meyer, it attracts millions of daily users. Today, Meyer earns modest revenue from Patreon, where dedicated Quordle fans can donate to keep their favorite puzzle game running.

How is Quordle pronounced?

“Kwordle.” It should rhyme with “Wordle,” and definitely should not be pronounced exactly like "curdle.”

Is Quordle strategy different from Wordle?

Yes and no.

Your starting strategy should be the same as with Wordle. In fact, if you have a favorite Wordle opening word, there’s no reason to change that here. We suggest something rich in vowels, featuring common letters like C, R, and N. But you do you.

After your first guess, however, you’ll notice things getting out of control if you play Quordle exactly like Wordle.

What should I do in Quordle that I don’t do in Wordle?

Solving a Wordle puzzle can famously come down to a series of single letter-change variations. If you’ve narrowed it down to “-IGHT,” you could guess “MIGHT” “NIGHT” “LIGHT” and “SIGHT” and one of those will probably be the solution — though this is also a famous way to end up losing in Wordle, particularly if you play on “hard mode.” In Quordle, however, this sort of single-letter winnowing is a deadly trap, and it hints at the important strategic difference between Wordle and Quordle: In Quordle, you can't afford to waste guesses unless you're eliminating as many letters as possible at all times.

Guessing a completely random word that you already know isn't the solution, just to eliminate three or four possible letters you haven’t tried yet, is thought of as a desperate, latch-ditch move in Wordle. In Quordle, however, it's a normal part of the player's strategic toolset.

Is there a way to get the answer faster?

In my experience Quordle can be a slow game, sometimes dragging out longer than it would take to play Wordle four times. But a sort of blunt-force guessing approach can speed things up. The following strategy also works with Wordle if you only want the solution, and don’t care about having the fewest possible guesses:

Try starting with a series of words that puts all the vowels (including Y) on the board, along with some other common letters. We've had good luck with the three words: “NOTES,” “ACRID,” and “LUMPY.” YouTuber DougMansLand suggests four words: “CANOE,” “SKIRT,” “PLUMB,” and “FUDGY.”

Most of the alphabet is now eliminated, and you’ll only have the ability to make one or two wrong guesses if you use this strategy. But in most cases you’ll have all the information you need to guess the remaining words without any wrong guesses.

If strategy isn't helping, and you're still stumped, here are some hints:

Are there any double or triple letters in today’s Quordle words?

One word has a letter that occurs twice.

Are any rare letters being used in today’s Quordle like Q or Z?

No.

What do today’s Quordle words start with?

I, C, S, and S.

What are the answers for today’s Quordle?

Are you sure you want to know?

There’s still time to turn back.

OK, you asked for it. The answers are:

It's the end of the week, and the beginning of a new Wordle! It's both a trick and a treat to kick off your Halloween weekend, but we've got some clues and the solution to help you out, as we do every day.

If you just want today's word, you can jump straight to the end of this article for October 28's Wordle solution, for puzzle #496. If you'd rather work through it yourself, keep reading for some tips, tricks, and clues.

Where did Wordle come from?

Wordle was initially created by engineer Josh Wardle as a gift for his partner, though it quickly spread until it became an international phenomenon. Thousands of players across the globe tackle Wordle each day, with some fans even having created alternate versions of the daily word puzzle game. These include battle royale format Squabble, music identification game Heardle, and variations like Dordle and Quordle that make you guess multiple words at once.

The popularity of Wordle even reached such heights that the New York Times bought it earlier this year, while TikTok creators live-stream themselves playing it.

What's the best Wordle starting word?

The goal of Wordle is to have fun, and there's no right way to have fun. Just choose whatever starting word feels right to you, and don't let anyone shame you for it. However, if you want to take a more strategic approach, we have a few ideas to help you pick a word that will spark joy. One tip is to select a word that includes at least two different vowels, plus some common consonants like S, T, R, or N.

What happened to the Wordle archive?

The entire archive of past Wordles used to be available for anyone to play in glorious days gone by. Unfortunately it has since been taken down, with the website's creator stating it was done at the request of the New York Times.

Is Wordle getting harder?

If you're finding Wordle too easy, you can try enabling its Hard Mode to give your brain a tougher challenge. But Wordle isn't getting any harder by itself — it's the same difficulty that it's always been.

Why are there two different Wordle answers some days?

Wordle is a fun, collective experience specifically because everyone's solving for the same word every day. Occasionally, though, Wordle has accepted two different solutions as correct on the same day. This is because the New York Times made changes to the Wordle word list after acquiring it, and sometimes swaps out words from the original list. To ensure you're getting the right answer every day, refresh your browser before you play — the site will save your streak.

Here's a subtle hint for today's Wordle answer:

It's a verb, a noun, and (almost) a shoe.

Does today's Wordle answer have a double letter?

Not today.

Today's Wordle is a 5-letter word that starts with...

The letter... S.

It's finally done. Finished. Complete. There's no going back now.

Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, now officially owns Twitter. The deal closed at the original agreed upon price of $44 billion, or $54.20 per share.

The billionaire was able to secure $12.5 billion in loans from the banks for his acquisition. Other investors, such as Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, pitched in an additional $7.1 billion. It's unclear how much more Musk was able to wrangle from outside investors and just how much of his Tesla stock holdings he had to sell off to make up the rest.

Musk had until 5pm ET on Friday to close the deal or head to court. It was very likely Musk would have been forced to complete the deal in the Delaware Court of Chancery. Going the original route saves Musk from additional costs and headaches, like even more embarrassing text messages being released as part of the proceedings such as the ones that showed he has some terrible ideas for how to run a social media platform.

Elon Musk himself is a Twitter power user, regularly tweeting on the platform where he has amassed nearly 110 million followers. However, the billionaire first seriously showed interest in ownership of Twitter when he started acquiring large amounts of Twitter stock in March 2022. The billionaire was quite vocal during that time period about what he didn't like about the platform. He criticized the amount of spam, the lack of certain features like an edit button, and content moderation policies on the platform. Musk contemplated joining the Twitter board of directors in early April before ultimately deciding to turn the opportunity down and make an offer to buy the platform outright later that month.

Buyers' remorse seemed to set in almost immediately after Musk agreed to acquire the platform. By July, he was looking to officially back out of the deal. Musk claimed he had an out because he had not been informed of the severity of fake accounts and spam on the platform. However, that claim was always dubious as Musk often cited that fixing these issues were reasons he wanted to acquire the platform to begin with. But, more importantly, Musk had no such opt-out option. He has officially signed an iron clad contract with Twitter to acquire the company.

And now here we are. Elon Musk owns Twitter. But, while one saga ends, a new story just begins.

Musk starts out heading the social media company with an already tumultuous relationship with Twitter's employees. Musk has already butted heads with Twitter executives on a public forum. It was just a few months ago that Elon Musk targeted Twitter's legal head Vijaya Gadde, which led to her harassment by users on the very platform she worked for. Per reports by the New York Times and CNBC, Musk has now fired Gadde, along with general counsel Sean Edgett, CEO Parag Agrawal , and CFO Ned Segal.

The billionaire just recently claimed he would fire 75 percent of the company's staff once he took the reins. While there is a good case to be made that Musk actually won't do that – he has a long history of saying things he doesn't deliver on – Twitter employees aren't taking any chances while their livelihoods hang in the balance. Twitter staff has already penned an open letter to their new boss explaining how detrimental it would be to conversation on the platform to lose so many employees. Twitter's employees also had a more basic request too.

"We demand transparent, prompt and thoughtful communication around our working conditions," reads the letter. "We demand to be treated with dignity, and to not be treated as mere pawns in a game played by billionaires."

Then there's the question of what happens from a user standpoint. Those aforementioned Musk text messages showed little to no understanding of how to run a social media platform. One idea from Musk was to have users pay to put their tweets on a blockchain as a sort of verification method to prove they were real, for example.

Another question addresses another part of Twitter that Musk had a problem with and that was content moderation. Musk has already said he would bring back President Donald Trump to the platform. Trump was banned after continuing to stoke tensions while a pro-Trump mob rioted at the Capitol building on Jan. 6, 2021. What other suspensions would he reverse?

For now, Twitter will likely remain as is for its users. Musk already overpaid for the platform and he has a good deal to lose if he tanks it.
It's finally done. Finished. Complete. There's no going back now.

Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, now officially owns Twitter. The deal closed at the original agreed upon price of $44 billion, or $54.20 per share.

The billionaire was able to secure $12.5 billion in loans from the banks for his acquisition. Other investors, such as Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, pitched in an additional $7.1 billion. It's unclear how much more Musk was able to wrangle from outside investors and just how much of his Tesla stock holdings he had to sell off to make up the rest.

Musk had until 5pm ET on Friday to close the deal or head to court. It was very likely Musk would have been forced to complete the deal in the Delaware Court of Chancery. Going the original route saves Musk from additional costs and headaches, like even more embarrassing text messages being released as part of the proceedings such as the ones that showed he has some terrible ideas for how to run a social media platform.

Elon Musk himself is a Twitter power user, regularly tweeting on the platform where he has amassed nearly 110 million followers. However, the billionaire first seriously showed interest in ownership of Twitter when he started acquiring large amounts of Twitter stock in March 2022. The billionaire was quite vocal during that time period about what he didn't like about the platform. He criticized the amount of spam, the lack of certain features like an edit button, and content moderation policies on the platform. Musk contemplated joining the Twitter board of directors in early April before ultimately deciding to turn the opportunity down and make an offer to buy the platform outright later that month.

Elon Musk is reportedly now officially in charge of Twitter, setting the scene for the platform's looming descent into a microblogged reenactment of Lord of the Flies. And apparently he's already started cleaning house.

According to CNBC's David Faber, Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal and CFO Ned Segal have left the company's headquarters in San Francisco for the last time, shoved out the door by Musk's decree. They aren't the only executives that Musk has apparently fired either, with sources speaking to The New York Times adding head legal and policy executive Vijaya Gadde and general counsel Sean Edgett to the list of those let go.

Musk's $44 billion acquisition of Twitter was expected to result in staff cuts, with the wealthiest individual in the world having previously stated he planned on reducing the company's workforce by up to 75 percent. This would mean letting go of up to 5,000 employees.

There were some doubts as to whether Musk would actually follow through with his proposed cuts, and a handful of high-powered CEOs is a far cry from thousands of workers. But it wouldn't be surprising if Musk is just getting started. A source speaking to Bloomberg stated that Musk plans to take on the role of Twitter's CEO, though he may eventually hand it off to someone else. After all, he's already the CEO of both SpaceX and Tesla.

Bloomberg also reports that Musk has asked Twitter's engineers to meet with Tesla engineers according to its sources. The former reportedly showed the latter the company's code so they could run Musk through it.

Yesterday Musk tweeted a video of himself carrying a sink into Twitter's headquarters, captioned "Entering Twitter HQ – let that sink in!" He also tweeted a message to advertisers, attempting to keep the money rolling in by reassuring them Twitter will remain a safe space for ads, honest. Musk's laissez-faire view of content moderation has resulted in concerns Twitter may become a platform brands hesitate to associate with — apprehension he likely wants quash before it dries up Twitter's primary revenue stream.

Acquiring a company and immediately firing the people who've been running it seems like a pretty risky idea, particularly on the first day before you even have your feet beneath you. Then again, Musk isn't exactly known for his thoughtful, considered decision-making. We'll see how it works out for him.

This is a developing story...

This is a developing story...
TikTok owes a lot of people money. Not at some vague point in the future, but right now, thanks to a recent class action lawsuit. But given that everyone’s phone is blowing up all the time with scams and other garbage, it may register as untrustworthy when you get a notification saying you just got paid. Is something bad going to happen if you try and spend this so-called "money"?

Nope. It's just regular old money, and it's real. Certain users of TikTok (or Musical.ly, as it used to be known) are suddenly noticing that they've just been awarded an amount of money equivalent to a family meal at a fast food restaurant. Maybe you vaguely remember this was happening from reading news stories a year ago about money coming at some point. Well, we are now at that point.

What is the TikTok data privacy settlement?

You can read the full text of the settlement here, but the broad strokes go like this:

ByteDance, TikTok's parent company, got hit with a class action lawsuit back in 2019 for what the plaintiffs viewed as a violation of children's privacy rights under the federal Video Privacy Protection Act, meaning ByteDance had allegedly been disclosing which videos had been watched by which specific person. And it also alleged violations of Illinois' unique biometric tracking act that makes it illegal to distribute a "faceprint," if you will. From 2014-2019, the suit alleged, the owners of Musical.ly, and later TikTok, failed to acquire consent from the parents of users under 13.

The 2019 suit came after the Federal Trade Commission had already won a separate $5.7 million settlement of its own from ByteDance over similar violations earlier that same year. Part of their settlement with the FTC resulted in TikTok removing content posted by kids under 13.

In February of 2021 ByteDance agreed to a $91 million settlement, despite maintaining its innocence. That meant that users of either app from 2014 through Sept. 30, 2021 were eligible for an imminent payout...pending one or two more legal maneuvers. Then in August of 2022, a judge named John Lee of the Northern District of Illinois approved the settlement. Ah, but there were still nagging appeals to resolve.

Then, according to TikTokDataPrivacySettlement.com, a website affiliated with the legal team organizing the suit, the final appeal was dismissed on Oct. 12, at which point ByteDance must have started writing checks, because the "settlement administrator" started distributing money two weeks later — which was Wednesday, when people started seeing their bank accounts getting $27.84 heavier.

Who gets money from the TikTok data privacy settlement?

First of all, it's too late to get your money if this is the first you're hearing of this lawsuit. March 21, 2022 was the deadline to submit a claim, according to TikTokDataPrivacySettlement.com.

The next thing to know is that how much money is coming your way, having already filed your claim, depends on whether or not you were in Illinois during the time covered by the suit. If you're in the "nationwide class," meaning you live in the US and used the app prior to Sept. 30, 2021, you get $27.84. If you were in Illinois, and you not only used TikTok, but created videos before Sept. 30, 2021, then lucky you: You get $167.04.

So if you still haven’t gotten your money, keep watching the PayPal or Venmo account you used in your claim, or wait for an email or push notification that says you received a payment. $27.84 and $167.04 aren’t life-changing sums for most people, but hey: Enjoy a modest night out on ByteDance’s dime. You've earned it.

Put a microphone in front of Phil Spencer and the guy will always deliver.

Spencer, who you may or may not know as the head of Microsoft Gaming (he’s in charge of all things Xbox ), sat down with the Wall Street Journal at its WSJ Tech Live event for a wide-ranging interview about everything from Microsoft's plans for mobile gaming to Spencer's personal feelings on the metaverse. Spencer is one of the few industry leaders who actually gives real answers to questions on occasion (and comes across as "one of the good guys" for it), so let’s break down the highlights.

Metaverse catching strays

Undoubtedly the funniest thing Spencer said at WSJ Tech Live came at the expense of Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg-fueled metaverse efforts. As you can see at about the 1:15 mark in this clip from the WSJ YouTube channel, Spencer seemed to take a bit of a jab at Meta’s work-focused metaverse, without naming names of course.

“It’s a poorly built video game,” Spencer said. “Building a metaverse that looks like a meeting room, I just find that’s not where I want to spend most of my time.”

It’s not difficult to connect the dots and see this as a criticism of Meta’s Horizon Workrooms VR app. Zuckerberg’s corporate ambitions have almost become synonymous with the word “metaverse” itself. That said, it’s not like Microsoft is shunning the concept entirely. Spencer is just one guy in a much larger corporate machine; Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said earlier this year that acquiring Activision in a $69 billion deal would “provide building blocks for the metaverse,” whatever that means. Nadella also showed up at Meta Connect 2022 recently to announce Microsoft Teams (among other things) integration with Meta Quest headsets, so working in VR is part of Microsoft's agenda to some extent.

Call of Duty on Switch?!

Speaking of the Activision deal, a big part of that massive acquisition is the Call of Duty franchise. There’s been a bit of a war of words between executives at PlayStation and Xbox throughout 2022, as Sony believes Microsoft could eventually block the popular shooter series from releasing on PlayStation consoles at all. It’s been a sticking point for global market regulators who are in a position to potentially block the merger from happening if it proves too monopolistic.

For instance, the U.K.’s Competition and Markets Authority recently asked the public to weigh in on whether or not Call of Duty going exclusive would be bad for customers.

Anyway, Spencer tried to calm the masses at WSJ Tech Live, claiming the company wants Call of Duty on every platform, even the Nintendo Switch . That’s fascinating because Call of Duty has yet to grace Nintendo’s hybrid handheld console, potentially due to its relative lack of graphical horsepower. According to Spencer, that may change in the future.

It's also an interesting comment because it seems to position Microsoft as being magnanimous with its newest toy, despite the fact that keeping Call of Duty multiplatform would merely extend the status quo.

Remember kids, corporations aren't your friends.

Mobile ambitions

Spencer also spoke about Microsoft’s mobile gaming plans ( the video is available on the WSJ website ), which right now mostly extend to cloud streaming Xbox games to Android devices and iPhones via the Xbox Game Pass subscription service. However, another huge part (arguably the biggest, at least monetarily) of that Activision deal is the inclusion of massive mobile games like Candy Crush Saga. If the deal goes through, Microsoft will rake in cash from a whole new marketplace that Spencer called the biggest gaming platform on the planet.

“We want to be in a position with content and players and storefront capability to take advantage of [mobile gaming],” he said. “Gaming is the largest form of monetization on mobile and we’re a gaming company.”

Interestingly, Spencer also spoke of the “duopoly” of Google and Apple controlling the only two viable mobile storefronts: the Google Play Store and the iOS App Store, respectively. Both companies take 15 to 30 percent cuts of all in-app purchases from games on those storefronts. The Verge reported earlier this month that Microsoft wants to build its own mobile storefront, but we’ll see if that actually happens down the road.

It's also slightly funny to see Spencer position Microsoft almost as an underdog in the mobile space compared to Google and Apple. For what it's worth, all three companies have market capitalizations of more than $1 trillion, so this isn't exactly David vs. Goliath.

No Keystone, for now

Another one of Spencer's noteworthy quotes from the WSJ interview might deflate some hype you may have had for a rumored new piece of Xbox hardware.

Earlier this month, Spencer tweeted an image of a crowded memorabilia shelf that included a small white object on the top. This was largely thought to be Keystone, the codename for a streaming device Microsoft was said to be working on to facilitate Xbox gaming without expensive hardware.

Unfortunately, Spencer poked a hole in the hype tire and deflated all the air. According to Spencer, that little object was indeed Keystone, something Microsoft had been working on internally. But in spring of this year, the company decided to pivot to working with Samsung to add a game streaming app to its smart TVs rather than continue work on Keystone. In other words, Keystone ain't coming anytime soon.

Still, Spencer said it may only be a matter of time before something like that does come to the market.

"Will we do a streaming device at some point? I suspect we will," Spencer said. "But I think it's years away."

Get your Xbox now while it’s (not really) cheap

Could either of the new Xbox consoles get a price increase eventually? Credit: CHARLY TRIBALLEAU/AFP via Getty Images

Last but not least, Spencer talked about pricing on both Xbox hardware and Game Pass. The Xbox Series S currently costs $300 while the more powerful Series X is $500. Meanwhile, Game Pass is $10/mo for just console or PC games, or $15/mo for both plus the ability to stream games remotely.

“I don’t think we’ll be able to [maintain current prices] forever,” Spencer said, per The Verge . “I do think at some point we’ll have to raise some prices on certain things, but going into this holiday we thought it was really important that we maintain the prices that we have.”

Hardware price hikes in gaming are exceedingly rare, but so are the current global economic conditions.

The reason Spencer's comment is cause for concern at all is because Xbox would simply be following its rivals' lead. The PlayStation 5 already got a variable price increase in every market but the U.S. ahead of this holiday season. And Meta recently bumped the cost of its Quest 2 headset up $100, so now it starts at $400. Microsoft and Nintendo both confirmed in August they wouldn’t be following suit, but that could change in the near future.

Don’t be shocked if Game Pass eventually goes up in price, though. It’s an absurdly good deal right now, but subscription services always cost more eventually. Just ask Netflix .

Between the deflating Keystone news, the hilarious metaverse commentary, and the potential horror of an Xbox price increase, there's a ton to chew on with Spencer's comments at WSJ Tech Live. Naturally, a lot of it makes Microsoft seem like the good guys despite being a gargantuan corporation with many of the same aims as its rivals. It's amazing what a little honesty can do sometimes.

What: Weird: The Al Yankovic Story

Where to watch: The Roku Channel

Premiere date: November 4, 2022

It's high time to admit that “Weird Al” Yankovic is a true musical icon. Whether you've been a fan since the early days of "Eat It" or you're a more recent fan thanks to Stranger Things, you can't deny the musician's impact on pop culture over the past, oh, forty years. What's more, director Eric Appel’s satirical biopic promises to add even more pizazz to his lavish legacy.

So if you’re ready to get into an entirely unreal but definitely hilarious recount of Yankovic’s life, here’s everything you need to know about the upcoming flick.

How can I watch Weird: The Al Yankovic Story?

The film is exclusively streaming on The Roku Channel for free starting Nov. 4.

Is Weird: The Al Yankovic Story actually a biopic?

Yes, but also no. The film is loosely based on Yankovic’s life, but the screenplay — which was co-written by Yankovic himself — is more concerned with poking fun at the tropes directors rely on for musical biopics and shows like Behind the Music. Starring a bewigged Daniel Radcliffe, Weird is a fun, amped-up retelling of Yankovic’s life, from the first moment he laid eyes on an accordion, all the way to his “friendship” with Madonna, with every detail purposefully exaggerated for comedic effect.

The cast includes Evan Rachel Wood as Madonna, Rainn Wilson as Dr. Demento, Quinta Brunson as Oprah, and Toby Huss and Julianne Nicholson as his parents, along with a whole smorgasbord of blink-and-you'll-miss-them cameos. Yankovic, who also has a cameo, provides the vocals for Radcliffe’s musical scenes.

What are people saying about the film?

In anticipation of the film's premiere at TIFF , Mashable’s own Kristy Puchko asks, “Who better to take the prestigious subgenre of musician biopic down a peg than the (polka) king of parody?” Puchko also praises Radcliffe’s career, noting that he’s used his “post-Potter years to make such mad and brilliant comedies [like] Swiss Army Man and Miracle Workers ,” making him the perfect pick to “play the notoriously squeaky clean accordion player as a vicious, sex-crazed ego maniac.”

What: Weird: The Al Yankovic Story

Where to watch: The Roku Channel

Premiere date: November 4, 2022

It's high time to admit that “Weird Al” Yankovic is a true musical icon. Whether you've been a fan since the early days of "Eat It" or you're a more recent fan thanks to Stranger Things, you can't deny the musician's impact on pop culture over the past, oh, forty years. What's more, director Eric Appel’s satirical biopic promises to add even more pizazz to his lavish legacy.

How can I watch Weird: The Al Yankovic Story?

The film is exclusively streaming on The Roku Channel for free starting Nov. 4.

Is Weird: The Al Yankovic Story actually a biopic?

Yes, but also no.

I love the show Bar Rescue — I promise this is coming back to Elon Musk and Twitter, trust me — and it's taught me something valuable.

The show is exactly what it sounds like: Tough-but-fair industry expert Jon Taffer rescues failing bars, usually from negligent, oft-drunk owners. Time and again, the owners are failing because they like going to bars, then soon discover owning a successful bar involves none of that fun. It is work.

In short: I learned that though I enjoy going to a bar, I would never, ever try to run one. And now we're back to Musk.

See, the billionaire is apparently about to buy Twitter, his favorite online playground. He loves tweeting, so it probably seemed like it would be fun to own Twitter. But a post from Musk on Thursday seemed to indicate he is running into the realities of actually owning Twitter. He posted a statement directed at advertisers, courting them and promising, it seems, some level of content moderation. The lion's share of Twitter's revenue comes from advertisers, and for the platform to survive, Musk, at least for the time being, will need to keep them happy and their wallets open.

You can read the full statement in Musk's tweet, which begins, fittingly, with, "Dear Twitter advertisers."

The gist of the letter, though, is effectively: please advertisers, don't fret. While taking shots at "traditional media" and making the requisite references to the need to calm the far-right and far-left, Musk hinted that Twitter will still have some form of content moderation. That's important to advertisers, because companies don't want their products associated with extreme views posted to a platform.

"Twitter obviously cannot become a free-for-all hellscape, where anything can be said with no consequences!" Musk wrote in his tweet. "In addition to adhering to the laws of the land, our platform must be warm and welcoming to all, where you can choose your desired experience according to your preferences, just as you can choose, for example, to see movies or play video games ranging from all ages to mature."

Musk said that while low-quality ads can be a nuisance, high-quality ads are welcome.

"Fundamentally, Twitter aspires to be the most respected advertising platform in the world that strengthens your brand and grows your enterprise," he wrote.

That kind of thoughtful, nearly reasonable statement is in stark contrast to some of Musk's wilder posts on Twitter. You know, his frequent posts about Russia's war in Ukraine, or claims about bots, or speculating wrongly about COVID, or claiming, without evidence, a person is a pedophile. Perhaps most notably, he tweeted frequently about Twitter itself, and the need for unfettered free speech.

After a long saga of bids, withdrawals, and a lawsuit, Musk looks set to actually own Twitter ahead of the purchase deadline on Friday. And that means Musk has to care about advertisers and creating a platform they'll support. He spent $44 billion on the dang thing, after all. Might as well keep it alive.

It's like owning a bar. It's all fun and games until the rent comes due. Musk is apparently about to actually run Twitter, not just complain about it. With his new courtship of advertisers, it seems he's let that sink in.

Back in April when Elon Musk said he was buying Twitter, an intense debate kicked off online over whether or not to leave the social media platform. At the time, many users reacted in outrage, vowing to leave the platform over the change of hands and presumed consequences.

Now that the reality of Musk buying Twitter has sunken in (quite literally, too, as Musk entered Twitter HQ yesterday carrying a sink like the one-man meme band he is), the debate over whether or not to leave Twitter has revved up again. Some have dramatically announced their departure from Twitter with the pomp and fanfare of a professional athlete announcing their retirement.

But other brave souls have chosen to sacrifice their wellbeing and stay on the platform...in protest. In the last 24 hours, the hashtag #IWasGoingToQuitTwitter has exploded. Some users posting the hashtag claim they're staying to see how the messy drama unfolds, while others are holding on so they don't lose their hard-earned following and clout.

Here's a smattering of why people can't quit Twitter just yet.

Fighting the good fight

Some can't resist the allure of the doomscrolling

Where else would we get our memes?

Twitter is a critical marketing tool for some

The popcorn is popped and they're staying for the inevitable chaos

Someone tell this user there's life outside of social media

Then there's this pragmatic approach

Ultimately...meh.

Nugget ice just tastes better than regular ol' frozen water. That's why the GE Profile Countertop Nuggest Ice Maker made such a splash on TikTok last year and continues to be a top seller. It's still not cheap by any means at $429, but it is $100 more affordable than usual — and on par with its lowest price ever (which it hit on Prime Day 2 a few weeks ago). If producing 24 pounds of perfect ice per day in a countertop machine is on your wishlist, it's definitely worth the investment.

Shark keeps producing affordable Dyson competitors that rival the real thing. The HyperAIR Fast-Drying Blow Dryer is no exception. Just $10 short of its lowest price to date, the Shark HyperAIR is still a steal at $179.99. It uses high-velocity heated air and negatively charged ionized air to get the blow-drying job done quickly, while preventing heat damage and controlling frizz. It comes with the IQ 2-in-1 Concentrator, as well as the IQ Styling Brush attachment, and you can choose from rose, matcha, or stone shades.

These days everyone seems to be getting out of gaming, but TikTok wants in.

According to a new report by the Financial Times, TikTok is about to launch a gaming tab on its app, allowing users to play mobile games. These games will feature ads, and users will be able to pay for additional content, the report claims.

TikTok first started testing games in Vietnam in May. The service's moderators in Europe were tasked with testing games ahead of launch, says the Financial Times, citing two people with inside knowledge.

All of this could be announced on November 2, when TikTok is hosting its "first global gaming event," with the tagline "TikTok Made Me Play It."

Featured Video For You Fortnite, MultiVersus, and the Thrill of Crossover Games

"The future of gaming is here—and it's happening on TikTok. Leading publishers are launching games on our platform as culturally relevant entertainment properties, building communities, and inspiring broader entertainment audiences to discover and play their games," reads a description on the event's website.

Some of TikTok's competitors haven't had much luck with gaming, though. Snapchat launched playable games in 2019 only to announce it would shut down gaming in August, and Facebook is shutting down its gaming platform on Friday, Oct. 28. Netflix, which launched its gaming product last year, recently said it would double down and push into cloud gaming as well as launch more games.

When Taylor Swift releases an album, it's a cultural moment. And nowhere is it felt more intensely than on TikTok. Whether it be her re-recorded Red (Taylor's Version) or the brand-new Midnights, her music inspires all sorts of trends on the platform.

Before Midnights arrived, Swift debuted every track title on TikTok, turning the platform into the go-to destination for fans to anticipate the album and concoct theories. As soon as the clock struck midnight on Oct. 21 Swifties ran to TikTok to post their reactions, fan edits, and create new trends inspired by the music of Midnights.

Here are a few of our favorite Midnights-inspired trends on TikTok.

It's me. Hi. I'm the problem it's me.

"Anti-Hero" is the first single off the album, and it's a trove of relatable lyrics about facing your inner critic. If there's one thing we know about TikTok it's that users love sharing why they relate to something and personalizing a popular song to their own experiences.

Users have been posting the ways in which, like Swift, they are the problem. Swift exclusively partnered with YouTube Shorts for the #TSAntiHeroChallenge, encouraging users to post why they're the problem — but the TikTok trend grew organically on the app.

It's not just the pointed lyricism that has motivated fans to post to "Anti-Hero" on TikTok. Users are also using the music video in which Swift portrays her insecurities as a muse, featuring plenty of '70s aesthetics. "As professional at overthinking myself I really wanted to create my own version," 21-year-old Hannah Rose, who posts music-inspired videos under the username @foundinmyphone, told Mashable. "What I love about the music video is how, despite dealing with a deeply sad topic, it has light-hearted, comedic elements that almost make you see how irrational and silly thinking so harshly of yourself is."

Rose's brilliant, personalized recreation of the video was viewed over 2 million time, and it even earned a like from Swift herself.

"The whole concept of being your own worst enemy sometimes is such a universal feeling, even when told through the lens of Taylor Swift, who’s had such an extraordinary life. She still captures it so perfectly for everyone," Rose shared. Rose isn't the only Swiftie who has made their own version of the music video; she says her FYP is full of other people's interpretations and recreations. (And Swift, if you're reading this, Rose is available for any future secret sessions.)

I can still make the whole place shimmer

No one is having more fun than those posting to "Bejeweled." The second single from Midnights encourages listeners to embrace themselves even when others criticize you. Best believe the Swifties are sparkling in self-love thanks to this track.

There are several trends soundtracked by "Bejeweled." There's @mikael.arellano's "Bejeweled" strut and shimmer hands that has rightly inspired a wave of copycats. He may have created the most simple, yet iconic TikTok dance to date.

But "Bejeweled" isn't just for the dancers. It's also become the score to many transition videos, thanks to 28-year-old Miguel Dotto. He started the trend using the lyric "and by the way I'm going out to tonight" to switch from a pre-going out look to a clip of him out on the town. Since posting, Dotto has been tagged in dozens of videos of other Swifties doing the trend.

What if I told you none of it was accidental?

There's nothing like a Swift song to get girls on the internet to spill their guts. This time it's "Mastermind" that's encouraging people to expose some of their more unhinged tendencies. In "Mastermind," Swift describes how she schemed to make sure the object of her affection fell in love with her, and TikTokkers are sharing their most outlandish stories about how they schemed their way into someone's heart.

For example, @victoriabrowne posted a video to "Mastermind" in which the caption reads, "remembering that time I really wanted my crush to invite me over so when we were snapchatting and I asked what he was doing and he replied 'watching the new OJ Simpson Doc' I said 'same! What episode?' and he said '3' and I said 'omg me too' to tee him up to say 'we should watch 4 together' which he did...so I went over and had no idea what was going on in the series because I had actually never seen it and now we are married."

Now that's a Machiavellian tactic right out of Swift's playbook.

House of the Dragon may have concluded its first season, but that doesn't mean we have to stop obsessing over it.

WB Shop has released an exclusive, limited-edition Caraxes Funko Pop figure: an adorable rendition of the otherwise terrifying dragon belonging to Daemon Targaryen. Standing at about four inches tall, the toy features a distinctive metallic glaze and burgundy hue, mirroring the on-screen Caraxes. The miniature one just happens to be cuter.

The figure is the latest in a line of House of the Dragon-themed Funko Pops, including Rhaenyra Targaryen, Daemon Targaryen, King Viserys, Alicent Hightower, and more.

Apple's 12.9-inch iPad Pro isn't big enough for you? You might be in luck, as Apple is reportedly working on a far larger version.

According to a report by The Information, Apple is developing a 16-inch iPad, which should hit the market in the fourth quarter of 2023. The outlet claims that this device could further blur the line between the iPad and the MacBook, something Apple has been trying to do ever since it launched the first iPad Pro.

We've heard rumors about a larger iPad before. In 2021, Bloomberg's Mark Gurman said Apple's engineers and designers are "exploring" larger iPads, though he only mentioned the 14-inch to 16-inch display size in the context of his own idea of what Apple should do. This summer, analyst Ross Young said that he had "confirmed" a 14.1-inch iPad Pro is being developed. Both said Apple is unlikely to launch this device until next year.

But The Information's report says Apple is going even bigger, with a 16-inch iPad. If real, it would by far be the largest tablet in Apple's lineup, which currently ranges from the 8.3-inch iPad mini to the 12.9-inch iPad Pro. It would be on par with Apple's largest MacBook pro, which also has 16-inch display. It would probably be primarily aimed at artists, designers, and other users who really need that massive touchscreen for their daily work. And, while definitely losing some portability, it would likely be the most "pro" iPad in the company's lineup.

Another recent rumor said that Apple is working on a version of macOS that would work with the iPad Pro. We're taking this one with a big chunk of salt, but if true, it might mean that Apple is working on an entirely new class of iPad, one that would be much closer to a traditional laptop.
Apple's 12.9-inch iPad Pro isn't big enough for you? You might be in luck, as Apple is reportedly working on a far larger version.

The first time Yasmine Sahid popped up on my For You Page, she was imitating herself "visiting home during the holidays as the main character." She shyly pushed her hair behind her ear, pretended to be famous, and generally acted like the world revolved around her while Lana del Rey played in the background. I watched the video at least 20 times. Then I sent Sahid's follow-up video about meeting old friends at a hometown bar to my younger sister, who laughed so hard she cried.

Sahid has a special knack for making the personal universal, especially for women who were teens in the 2000s and 2010s. Whether mocking Twilight or the dramatic "Dis-knees" of Disney Channel stars, Sahid's videos are humbling and hilarious reminders that none of us have ever had a unique experience.

Earlier this week, as her cat August zoomed around behind her, Sahid told Mashable why Main Character Syndrome is so intoxicating, and why she recently released a song about it. "Everyone thinks they're the main character when not everyone can be the main character," she laughs. "So it's just kind of like poking fun of myself and having those moments where you feel like everyone's looking at you. And just just basking in the delusion because, why not? Like is so short."

So, what's on the TikTok virtuoso's For You Page? In no particular order, here are all the videos Sahid's been delighting in lately.

1. "2000s Disney Halloween movies be like"

This video made me go back and look up all my favorite Disney Channel Original Movies. I remember Xenon and the Cheetah Girls, obviously, but I forgot that Motocrossed was my shit. Do you remember Cadet Kelly? Eddie's Million Dollar Cook-Off? Smart House?

Yes! I also loved Halloween Town and Don't Look Under the Bed. I feel like this guy got the mannerisms right. The floating glasses? Oh, my God, that shit cracked me up. The different monster characters, the tropes, the lines. It pretty well done, too. I've done videos kind of like that, and it takes a lot of time and effort.

You bring back memories for me that I don't even remember. Where do you pull inspiration stuff from?

Honestly, things just pop in my mind. I don't have a method or rhyme or reason. A lot of it is watching Disney Channel shows or scrolling on Instagram or TikTok and then something from a nostalgia page pops up.

It's been nice to see that you're not just a '90s baby, but you're a Tumblr girlie, too.

Oh, for sure. My friends in grade school read a lot of books and would go on Tumblr to see people talk about them. I would just watch them scroll through, and they got me into 1D. This was during the X Factor days, way before they even got popular. The first video I remember watching of them on Tumblr was from their video diaries, the one where they were all in different onesies. Then I got more into Tumblr in high school — the fanfics, the writing — I was just obsessed with it, scrolling on my little iPod touch. Marina. Twilight. One Direction. Vampire Weekend.



2. #catsofTikTok

I quote the exact line from this video all the time which is Mike Wazowski's "You and me, me and you, both of us together!" from Monsters, Inc. I have a bunch of things that I say in conversation that I every once in a while realize are from Disney movies. What are some of yours?

I say "Good morning, everyone! The tank is clean and we are... gasp the tank is clean!" all the time. I quote a lot of That's So Raven. Like the episode with that babysitter [season 3, episode 33] where the characters says, "I just put a little dash of cinnamon!" and Chelsea pretends to choke as if it was poison… Tears are coming out of my eyes! I recently rewatched the whole series and listening to the jokes now as an adult, I realized there were a couple of innuendos so cleverly written in. It's so good.

Obviously, you're in love with your cat, August. So maybe these cat videos are an extension of that?

Ever since I got him, cat videos have been all over my For You Page. I grew up with a bichon and was always a dog lover. But I rescued August. A friend discovered him in the bushes in front of her apartment building and was trying to find him a home. She was like, "I just want to show you the cat." The first time I met him he was so cute and ran up to us, started rubbing my legs, bumping his head into me, just super sweet. And I was like, 'Oh, I can't leave."

OK, so this video... there's no way that any cat that I've ever had would have sat still for this long.

I know! I tried putting bat wings on August and he doesn't even like having the collar on him. This creator said she just placed the lash on the cat's eye lid, there was no lash glue.

Did you see that recent TikTok video of a cat in the full costume that's sitting at the edge of a table while his owners coo at him and take pictures?

Yes! And then he fell down? Yeah, August could never. He's getting chunky, too. I started cutting down his kibble.

Have you tried a laser for exercise?

No! I got a $30 like electric mouse that just roams around on its own. But it just keeps getting stuck. Some of these places are selling these high-tech toys that are so expensive. But [cats] just want the dumbest thing. He was recently playing with a ball of tape.

4. "The Grim Gallows of the Whaley House" | Ghost Files

What do you like about the Watcher duo, Shane and Ryan?

I'm obsessed with them and started watching them on "Buzzfeed Unsolved." When they released this new ghost-hunting show, I was so excited. You'll be scared, and then they have a comedic break that makes you feel more comfortable. So you can watch it and laugh at it and be spooked at the same time.

Are you obsessed with ghost hunting in general? Did you ever watch Ghost Adventures on TV?

I loved watching them when I was growing up, but it was always too masculine for me, too abrasive. I love this new wave of YouTube ghost hunting where it's less in your face. There's more of a discovery to things. I was watching Garrett Watts, and he makes a really good example of how [shows like Ghost Adventures] go into these places and are like, "show yourself you little bitch!" And of course, you're not gonna get any [paranormal activity that way] because who wants to show themselves to someone who is yelling at them?

[Watts] enters spaces with more respect and is more conversational. His videos are long, but I always put them on whenever I'm doing makeup or my hair. They're more empathetic

Do you believe in ghosts? It sounds like you do.

I do.

Have you had an encounter?

I haven't had a crazy one. In my West African culture they say if you smell cologne or perfume, it means you've been visited by someone. I was visiting my friend for my birthday dinner. I get in my car ,and I get this huge waft of lavender. After that, it smelled like my grandma's perfume on my car ride home. That night I was picking up my friend from work and was like, "Do you smell that?" and she was like "Yeah, it kind of smells like old lady perfume." I think it was my grandma coming back to say happy birthday to me. I had another instance where I smelled my dad's cologne in the room he died in. I asked my mom, "Did you spray something?" and she said no. She said she has smelled it herself a couple of times.

5. #rodgercleyeedit

Finally, I love Rodger Cleye edits.

Oh, my God, I've been obsessed with this trend. People comment suggestions of songs to cover, and he does it. Then accounts like this take the clip and edit him into situations that are so specific. There's one I saw that was like, "you learned that your celebrity crush is in a relationship," and he was singing a Lana del Rey song with candles and a bag of Cheetos. And I was like, this is so true! God, they're so fucking funny.

Welcome to Thanks, I Love It, our series highlighting something onscreen we're obsessed with this week.

Rupert Grint left a handprint on our hearts as boy wizard Ronald Weasley, and I’m delighted to announce that he’s essentially revived the character in Netflix's new horror anthology series, Guillermo del Toro’s Cabinet of Curiosities. Thanks to del Toro and co-writer Mika Watkins, there's fresh fun with menacing magic in episode six, where it feels like Hogwarts is back and it’s absolutely bonkers!

Based on the short story by H.P. Lovecraft, Grint’s episode, “Dreams in the Witch House,” follows Walter Gilman (Rupert Grint), a young man on a quest to prove the afterlife’s existence and save his deceased twin sister from its premature clutches. The episode is a jump-scare fest brimming with ominous occults, scornful sorceresses, and, most importantly, nonstop Harry Potter nods.

"Dreams in the Witch House" teases familiar figures and places.

Cabinet of Curiosities kicks off each episode with del Toro as host, cryptically introducing the episode's director, premise, and an important prop that ties the whole thing together. In “Dreams in the Witch House,” he brings forth a figure of helmer Catherine Hardwicke and a wooden dagger that looks suspiciously like a wand. In fact, if the prop wasn’t described as a dagger in the episode, I fear its wand resemblance would be all too canon.

The episode then spirals into a hellish nightmare that’s peopled with Hogwarts’ analogs. Walter’s best friend, Frank (Ismael Cruz Córdova) is a supportive and smart hero who wears a lovely little pair of circular glasses and never leaves his side. Remind you of anyone?

Meanwhile, Walter's twin sister, Epperly (Daphne Hoskins), is a freckled redhead who's steadfast, strong, and ridiculously courageous for her age, even going so far as to stab a horrifying witch right in the face. Lest I be redundant, but: Remind you of anyone??

Finally, a magical rat with a human face (voiced by Eric Woolfe) plagues Walter nonstop and is more or less a walking still frame of Scabbers turning into Peter Pettigrew. He even boasts Pettigrew’s painfully annoying personality. At this point, the only person left missing from Ron’s old entourage is Hermione.

Apart from wands and familiar friends, “Dreams in the Witch House” has settings that recall the Forbidden Forest and the Shrieking Shack. Walter’s journey takes him to the Forest of Lost Souls, a purgatorial home for those who aren’t ready to move on. The forest is eerie, dreary, and oh so foggy, much like Hogwarts’ dreadful Forbidden Forest. And Walter’s crudely advised to not leave any “ripple” behind upon entering the forest. It's a warning that would befit a journey in the wilderness surrounding Hogwarts as well!

Then, Walter seeks out the house of Salem’s worst witch, Keziah Mason (Lize Johnston), and spends the lousiest possible night of his life there. Keziah’s house is on the cusp of collapse, with everything from mold to satanic inscriptions painting its walls. And with its immediate aura of terror plaguing every one of its nooks and crannies, it might as well be the Shrieking Shack’s sister.

Names, nemeses, and never-ending magic tie Cabinet of Curiosities to Harry Potter's world.

Bellatrix?? Credit: Ken Woroner / Netflix

Gilderoy Lockhart, Madame Levine, Rita Skeeter, Keziah Mason — who are the Harry Potter imposters within this list? It’s hard to tell, isn't it? Even the characters’ names are reminiscent of the Wizarding World’s vernacular. (It’s Madame Levine (Nia Vardalos) and Keziah Mason, by the way.)

While Walter (aka, Ron) is fighting alongside comrades who might as well be the Order of the Phoenix, he’s also essentially on a quest to prove that magic is real. Yes, the character Rupert Grint plays wants to prove that mysticism exists among us Muggles. Epperley’s mysterious disappearance into an unknown vortex in their youth prompts Walter to go on a life-spanning quest to prove that demons, witches, blood magic, and all those occult obscurities are real. He becomes so obsessed that he’s willing to take liquid elixirs (drinkable drugs) to transport himself to the Forest of Lost Souls. Severus Snape would be so proud. From there, he spends the night at Keziah Mason’s house, only to square up against her in a battle of life or death.

Yes, his biggest enemy in the episode is a literal witch. She may be more ghoulish in appearance than the witches in Harry Potter, but she's no less powerful than they are. Keziah is able to contort Walter's body and control him, turn rats into weird amalgamated mini-humans, and perfectly orchestrate sacrifices to ensure her return to the living world. She’s a Death Eater’s dream woman. And Ron’s — I mean Walter’s —greatest nightmare.

Plopping Grint's familiar face into a witchy premise, it's impossible not to recall all the Hogwarts antics that came before. And so with some clever casting and familiar character types, Cabinet of Curiosities gives us a creepy tale of magic that feels like a Ronald Weasley from another time and place.

In a past life set in 1933 Boston, Ron might have been Walter Gilman, a lovely young lad who had no idea just how many adventures were ahead of him. But Harry Potter hyper-fixations aside, “Dreams in the Witch House” is actually a deliciously creepy episode to get you into the Halloween spirit. Three cheers to this rambunctious Rupert renaissance!

Got a question about sex that you're too embarrassed to ask? Mashable is here to answer all your burning sex questions — from the weird and wonderful, to the graphic and gory. Think of us as your sexy agony aunts.

Giving head, slobbing on the knob, going down, blowjobs, fellatio — whatever you want to call it, oral sex on penises is a very fun and pleasurable sexual activity.

Moushumi Ghose , MFT, a licensed sex therapist, says that there is a lot of psychological appeal in giving oral sex for penises. There is an intimacy to blowjobs that can make people feel connected and vulnerable. It can also be about service: "Psychologically speaking, folx who like to give blowjobs may also like the act of servicing, as servicing can be highly erotic," Ghose adds.

For the person getting a BJ, well, it feels amazing. "The head or the tip of the penis has a lot of nerve endings," Ghose explains. The sensation is quite different from using a hand or inserting it into a vagina."

But not everyone is a professional blowjob giver (or receiver, for that matter). The good news is that there are simple and easy things you can do to take your blowjob skills to the next level. There’s no "right" way to give a blowjob. Everyone enjoys different things, but there are some tried and true methods that can be helpful for anyone who wants to put a dick in their mouth with confidence.

Source yourself up with educational blowjob videos

There are plenty of amazing resources out there, if you feel like you want some "training" before you jump in. There are quite a few great video platforms, especially. Lucy Rowett , a certified sex coach and clinical sexologist, suggests Sex School Hub , Beducated , or GASM.tv . You can also opt for erotic apps like Dipsea , Ferly , and Emjoy , which have sections with lessons and practical skills too.

For more explicit videos, you can search for erotic performers who offer "how to" content. Check out Jenna Hunt, Sexpert Tayomi , and other creators on porn platforms, as they offer wonderful and straightforward instructions on how to give better blowjobs.

Communicate, communicate, communicate

Communication is key in all things sex. When it comes to oral, both people involved in the play have a responsibility to let each other know what they are and are not into. Not into deep-throating or hair pulling? Make that clear. Want to get some toys in the game? Let your partner know.

"It’s important to give a partner direction on how [you] like to receive oral sex."

Julieta Chiaramonte , a kink instructor, writer, and sex expert, says that you should let your partner know that you’re very open to receiving guidance. "If [they’re] receiving a blowjob, remember that no one knows [their] penis the way [they] do," she says. "It’s important to give a partner direction on how [you] like to receive oral sex."

If something isn’t working for you (or you want more of something), let your partner know gently. It’s entirely possible to communicate without hurting the ego.

You should never feel pressured to give a blowjob. Everyone involved should be enthusiastically consenting to the activity. This means everyone is 100 percent down and excited about the blowjob. Consent is always key.

The wetter the better

Don’t be afraid to put on a show. A huge component of a good BJ is throwing yourself into it and really getting sloppy with it. The wetter, the better. We’re talking spit flying, drooling, makeup melting down your face sloppy. "There is no such thing as too much spit. So let your juices out of your mouth," says Zachary Zane , sex expert for the queer cruising app, Sniffies .

"A sloppy blowjob can feel super warm, wet, and can actually help you out when avoiding the feeling of accidentally tugging the wrong way, or maybe a little bit of teeth slipped in," Chiramonte says. She also advises that you stay hydrated throughout the day to make getting all that juicy saliva in your blowjob a lot simpler. A dry mouth = a dry blowjob.

Another option is a flavored lube. You always want to be sure you’re using something sugar-free and free of harmful chemicals, as some brands can be, well, kind of shit. Lovehoney lubes come in a variety of flavors, including cherry. Just be sure you don’t have vaginal intercourse using flavored lubes, as this can be irritating to the vaginal flora and even cause a yeast infection.

And sure, being super slop-tastic won’t be appealing for every single person, but what is appealing is enthusiasm. Being happy, excited, and simply thrilled to have this peen in your mouth. We can all be self-conscious when both giving and receiving oral sex, so being excited and into it makes the experience more fun (and hot).

Start slowly

Rowett says that getting your whole body in on the buildup is key. "Start by teasing him/them. Grind your body against them, give them a body roll, kiss down from the chest or kiss up from the feet," she explains. "Kiss, stroke, and lick all around [their] body, every so often grazing the dick so that by the time you get there he's already getting hard in anticipation."

Then, move onto the penis. "Lick their dick up and down. When their penis is twitching because it’s so hard, start sucking harder," Chiaramonte says. Focusing on the head of the penis can be particularly pleasurable, as this is the area with the most nerve endings. The underside of the head has a small ridge on it. This is called the frenulum. It’s highly sensitive and many people with penises love to have it licked or stroked. Just be sure to ask if your partner is enjoying the stimulation, as it can be highly sensitive to direct touch (much like the clitoris).

It’s not a mouth-only service

Chiaramonte tells us that this is not just about oral sex. Using just your mouth can make for jaw pain — and honestly, who has time for that? "The key here is matching the pressure of your hand to the pressure of your mouth, so it feels like one fluid motion. When done correctly, your partner won’t even realize you’re using your hands," she says. "He’ll think it’s all mouth."

Use your hand to follow the way your mouth is moving. You can try straight up and down or use a twisting, cork-screw motion. Changing up your stroking/sucking style keeps your partner guessing. But remember, if they tell you they’re really enjoying something specific, keep doing that thing.

"The key here is matching the pressure of your hand to the pressure of your mouth, so it feels like one fluid motion."

You may also want to get the balls into the experience. This will need to be clearly communicated between you and your partner. "Some [people] like their testicles to be sucked or pulled on, but not all people do, so it’s good to ask prior," Chiaramonte explains. "Some testicles are VERY sensitive, so it does not feel good when [they are] pulled or sucked hard."

As for the anus, Rowett suggests "either insert[ing] a finger or two in or [put in] a butt plug or anal beads. Just remember to use lube as the anus doesn't lubricate — and spit is not enough!"

Again this will need to be discussed with your partner, as it’s all about preference. No one should ever do anything they’re not comfortable with. Good sex (and ethical sex, for that matter) must always include consent. Not everyone is into all sex things and that is A-OK.

OK, what about the gag reflex thing though?

You don’t need to deep-throat for a blowjob to feel amazing. Your hand can take off some that length. Do what feels most comfortable for you. With that being said, it doesn’t hurt to make "gagging noises" as a part of your blowjob, as this can be a huge turn on for both your partner and you.

Now, if you REALLY want to deepthroat, Chiaramonte says you can practice relaxing the throat while taking objects deep. For example, she herself would brush her teeth and then, once finished, use the toothbrush to touch the back of her throat to get used to the sensation. This isn’t for everyone, but if it’s important to you, you can make it happen.

You should enjoy it, too

You should give head if you enjoy giving head. "While it’s wonderful to give your partner a blow job and see them enjoy themselves, there is a certain power in learning how to enjoy the blow job for yourself. When you find a way to give a blow job and truly gain pleasure from it, that’s where the magic happens," Chiaramonte adds.

You should be having fun giving, too. That’s truly the most amazing trick of all. If you’re having a good time with it, it makes everything grand.
Got a question about sex that you're too embarrassed to ask? Mashable is here to answer all your burning sex questions — from the weird and wonderful, to the graphic and gory. Think of us as your sexy agony aunts.

Giving head, slobbing on the knob, going down, blowjobs, fellatio — whatever you want to call it, oral sex on penises is a very fun and pleasurable sexual activity.

Moushumi Ghose , MFT, a licensed sex therapist, says that there is a lot of psychological appeal in giving oral sex for penises. There is an intimacy to blowjobs that can make people feel connected and vulnerable. It can also be about service: "Psychologically speaking, folx who like to give blowjobs may also like the act of servicing, as servicing can be highly erotic," Ghose adds.

For the person getting a BJ, well, it feels amazing. "The head or the tip of the penis has a lot of nerve endings," Ghose explains. The sensation is quite different from using a hand or inserting it into a vagina."

But not everyone is a professional blowjob giver (or receiver, for that matter). The good news is that there are simple and easy things you can do to take your blowjob skills to the next level. There’s no "right" way to give a blowjob. Everyone enjoys different things, but there are some tried and true methods that can be helpful for anyone who wants to put a dick in their mouth with confidence.

Source yourself up with educational blowjob videos

There are plenty of amazing resources out there, if you feel like you want some "training" before you jump in. There are quite a few great video platforms, especially. Lucy Rowett , a certified sex coach and clinical sexologist, suggests Sex School Hub , Beducated , or GASM.tv . You can also opt for erotic apps like Dipsea , Ferly , and Emjoy , which have sections with lessons and practical skills too.

For more explicit videos, you can search for erotic performers who offer "how to" content. Check out Jenna Hunt, Sexpert Tayomi , and other creators on porn platforms, as they offer wonderful and straightforward instructions on how to give better blowjobs.

Communicate, communicate, communicate

Communication is key in all things sex. When it comes to oral, both people involved in the play have a responsibility to let each other know what they are and are not into. Not into deep-throating or hair pulling? Make that clear. Want to get some toys in the game? Let your partner know.

"It’s important to give a partner direction on how [you] like to receive oral sex."

Julieta Chiaramonte , a kink instructor, writer, and sex expert, says that you should let your partner know that you’re very open to receiving guidance. "If [they’re] receiving a blowjob, remember that no one knows [their] penis the way [they] do," she says. "It’s important to give a partner direction on how [you] like to receive oral sex."

If something isn’t working for you (or you want more of something), let your partner know gently. It’s entirely possible to communicate without hurting the ego.

It's Thursday again, and that means Friday is almost here. But a tough Quordle can make that glorious day seem further away, and who needs that?

If Quordle is a little too challenging today, you've come to the right place for hints. There aren't just hints here, but the whole Quordle solution. Scroll to the bottom of this page, and there it is. But are you sure you need all four answers? Maybe you just need a strategy guide. Either way, scroll down, and you'll get what you need.

What is Quordle?

Quordle is a five-letter word guessing game similar to Wordle, except each guess applies letters to four words at the same time. You get nine guesses instead of six to correctly guess all four words. It looks like playing four Wordle games at the same time, and that is essentially what it is. But it's not nearly as intimidating as it sounds.

Is Quordle harder than Wordle?

Yes, though not diabolically so.

Where did Quordle come from?

Amid the Wordle boom of late 2021 and early 2022, when everyone was learning to love free, in-browser, once-a-day word guessing games, creator Freddie Meyer says he took inspiration from one of the first big Wordle variations, Dordle — the one where you essentially play two Wordles at once. He took things up a notch, and released Quordle on January 30. Meyer's creation was covered in The Guardian six days later, and now, according to Meyer, it attracts millions of daily users. Today, Meyer earns modest revenue from Patreon, where dedicated Quordle fans can donate to keep their favorite puzzle game running.

How is Quordle pronounced?

“Kwordle.” It should rhyme with “Wordle,” and definitely should not be pronounced exactly like "curdle.”

Is Quordle strategy different from Wordle?

Yes and no.

Your starting strategy should be the same as with Wordle. In fact, if you have a favorite Wordle opening word, there’s no reason to change that here. We suggest something rich in vowels, featuring common letters like C, R, and N. But you do you.

After your first guess, however, you’ll notice things getting out of control if you play Quordle exactly like Wordle.

What should I do in Quordle that I don’t do in Wordle?

Solving a Wordle puzzle can famously come down to a series of single letter-change variations. If you’ve narrowed it down to “-IGHT,” you could guess “MIGHT” “NIGHT” “LIGHT” and “SIGHT” and one of those will probably be the solution — though this is also a famous way to end up losing in Wordle, particularly if you play on “hard mode.” In Quordle, however, this sort of single-letter winnowing is a deadly trap, and it hints at the important strategic difference between Wordle and Quordle: In Quordle, you can't afford to waste guesses unless you're eliminating as many letters as possible at all times.

Guessing a completely random word that you already know isn't the solution, just to eliminate three or four possible letters you haven’t tried yet, is thought of as a desperate, latch-ditch move in Wordle. In Quordle, however, it's a normal part of the player's strategic toolset.

Is there a way to get the answer faster?

In my experience Quordle can be a slow game, sometimes dragging out longer than it would take to play Wordle four times. But a sort of blunt-force guessing approach can speed things up. The following strategy also works with Wordle if you only want the solution, and don’t care about having the fewest possible guesses:

Try starting with a series of words that puts all the vowels (including Y) on the board, along with some other common letters. We've had good luck with the three words: “NOTES,” “ACRID,” and “LUMPY.” YouTuber DougMansLand suggests four words: “CANOE,” “SKIRT,” “PLUMB,” and “FUDGY.”

Most of the alphabet is now eliminated, and you’ll only have the ability to make one or two wrong guesses if you use this strategy. But in most cases you’ll have all the information you need to guess the remaining words without any wrong guesses.

If strategy isn't helping, and you're still stumped, here are some hints:

Are there any double or triple letters in today’s Quordle words?

Two words have letters that occur twice.

Are any rare letters being used in today’s Quordle like Q or Z?

No.

What do today’s Quordle words start with?

S, P, D, and B.

What are the answers for today’s Quordle?

Are you sure you want to know?

There’s still time to turn back.

OK, you asked for it. The answers are:
K-pop is full of fantastic tunes, feel-good bops, and certified bangers that anyone can enjoy, regardless of their proficiency with the Korean language. Even so, diving into the world of South Korean pop music can be intimidating to English speakers who are accustomed to understanding all of a song's lyrics.

Fortunately, you don't have to jump straight to songs with Korean lyrics in order to start exploring K-pop. Many K-pop artists have released English-language tunes that allow you to familiarise yourself with the performers and their sound before plunging into their wider discography. This has become increasingly common in recent years, as K-pop's global reach expands and idols seek to attract and cater to new audiences.

A lot of these releases are also just fantastic songs by themselves, regardless of whether you're interested in investigating K-pop any further.

In no particular order, here are some of the best English-language songs from K-pop idols.

1. "Love Talk" by WayV

This list is strictly limited to songs by K-pop idols that aren't just English-language versions of previous Korean releases. "Love Talk" by WayV was initially in Mandarin, so it doesn't count.

Released one week after the original Mandarin song, 2019's "Love Talk" is a smooth jam about an attraction between people who don't speak the same language. The alluring melody satisfyingly recalls '90s R&B and offers an appealing contrast between the seductive chorus and steady rap. This has won its music video almost 75 million views in under three years and over 107 million streams on Spotify.

You could justifiably argue that "Love Talk" isn't a K-pop song, as Mandarin is obviously not Korean. However, WayV is the Chinese subunit of K-pop group NCT, making the artists themselves K-pop idols. This means they clearly satisfy the arbitrary requirements for inclusion on this list that I made up. Besides, I wasn't about to leave "Love Talk" out. It's just too good to not recommend.

2. "LMLY" by Jackson Wang

"LMLY" by Jackson Wang is severely underrated, and I will continue to speak my truth until this retro '80s tune gets the attention it deserves.

Jackson has kept himself busy since he and his K-pop group GOT7 left JYP Entertainment, collaborating with artists such as RAIN, continuing to run his label Team Wang, and forming hip-hop group PANTHEPACK. While he is still working with GOT7, Jackson has also gone in hard on English-language solo work, experimenting with an entire spectrum of musical genres across songs such as "Blow" and "Cruel."

Yet out of all of this, it was the idol's 2021 nostalgic synth-pop tune "LMLY" that had me setting its Hong Kong cinema-inspired music video on loop. An acronym of "Leave Me Loving You," "LMLY" is a wistful song about the singer's fear that their lover is losing interest in them. "You don't call me baby / You call me my name," Jackson mourns. "But I keep on hoping / Nothing has changed." Like, ouch.

3. "The Feels" by TWICE

Do you love feel-good bops? Energetic, colourful performances? Addictive, appealing dances that are fun to learn yourself? Well then, please allow me to introduce you to your next nine girlfriends.

"The Feels" is the first original English-language single from hugely popular girl group TWICE, who have enjoyed massive success in South Korea and Japan for years. This solid, sweet 2021 love song about having "the feels" is a great introduction to TWICE for Western ears, offering a taste of the bright, catchy, optimistic tunes these seasoned performers excel at. Their sound certainly has an audience as well, with the music video racking up over 320 million views in just over a year.

If you're after more of TWICE's cute yet mature sound, the group has also released English versions of their Korean songs "More and More" and "I Can't Stop Me." You can't go too wrong wherever you start though — their entire discography is filled with tunes that will stick in your head and steal your heart.

4. "Dream of You" by CHUNG HA (with R3HAB)

"Dream of You" was a mandatory addition to this list, and I regret nothing. CHUNG HA's 2020 collaboration with R3HAB delivers a satisfyingly unapologetic banger, dripping with confidence and a highly danceable beat. CHUNG HA demands attention, irresistibly drawing all eyes and ears to her, and she knows it. This is one I've had on repeat, and I need you all to join me.

A sexually charged club song about enticing a lover into bed, "Dream of You" is also much more forward than the casual K-pop listener might expect. CHUNG HA paints a vivid picture of inviting her paramour back to her place, and isn't shy about what's likely to happen once they're alone.

"What can I say? Park the car and come on in / I got whisky, I got gin, and lingerie," sings CHUNG HA.

5. "Kiss of fire" by WOODZ

Technically "Kiss of fire" isn't entirely in English. Soloist WOODZ does throw in the tiniest pinch of Korean during the second verse, brief enough that you might miss it unless you know it's there. Still, 99 percent of the song's lyrics are in English, which feels like enough to let it sneak onto this list. I will make whatever excuses I need to for this excellent jam.

The Korean lyrics in "Kiss of fire" also won't prevent listeners who don't understand the language from understanding the song. Released in 2021, "Kiss of fire" is a contemporary R&B track about hot, burning love, with WOODZ flexing his falsetto to deliver a charismatic vocal performance over a rhythmic bass line.

If you're more interested in rock, WOODZ's "Dirt on my leather" is also worth checking out for an incredibly different vibe.

6. "Sweet Night" by V

BTS cemented their place in the Western music scene with English-language singles "Dynamite," "Butter," and "Permission to Dance," all of which are upbeat tunes that primarily endeavour to spread good vibes. (Don't pretend you haven't heard them. Ignorance and lies have never won anyone respect.) In contrast, "Sweet Night" by V strikes such a different tone that you'd have no idea he was a member of BTS unless you were told.

Recorded for the original soundtrack of 2020 Korean drama Itaewon Class, "Sweet Night" is a comforting, gentle acoustic song that's just as sweet as its title implies. V's soothing voice is complimented by Matilda Mann's pure backup vocals, and the whistled refrain leading out "Sweet Night" emphasises its simple, clean melody. It isn't difficult to understand how the music video has earned over 86 million views at time of writing. Pair this song with a quiet night and a warm cup of tea.

7. "Oh my god" by (G)I-DLE

(G)I-DLE's dark, ambiguously sapphic 2020 single "Oh my god" was released simultaneously in Korean and English — though only the former got the benefit of its visually striking music video, which accumulated 184 million views in a year and a half. Fortunately, fans took it upon themselves to edit the English audio on top of the Korean clip, so you can still get the full experience.

Though (G)I-DLE's trap-pop song is officially about love in all its forms, gay K-pop fans have embraced "Oh my god" as a "lesbian anthem," citing its liberal use of female pronouns as well as its religious imagery.

Also, just all of the lyrics. Listen to songwriter Soyeon sing "can't stop, girl, you make me sick" and try telling me "Oh my god" isn't queer coded with a straight face.

8. "Life's Too Short" by aespa

This 2022 song threw me right back to the pastel-coloured early '00s, strongly reminding me of the girl groups that used to populate my beloved Barbie-branded compilation CDs. Offering a laid back, nostalgic pop sound, "Life's Too Short" is an unbothered message to aespa's detractors — or anyone who sets out to put others down.

"I'm doin' me regardless," aespa declare. "And I don't care what you say about it / And it don't matter if you like it or not / I'm having all this fun, so why would I ever stop?"

Earning almost 50 million views in just under four months, "Life's Too Short" is a self-affirming song with sweet harmonies that hearken back to the simpler times of butterfly clips and gel pens.

9. "2 MINUS 1" by SEVENTEEN

Though credited to SEVENTEEN as a whole, "2 MINUS 1" only features the 13-member boy group's two most fluent English speakers: Joshua and Vernon. These members were also on the writing team for "2 MINUS 1," which became the first completely English-language song in SEVENTEEN's discography upon its release in 2021.

Inspired by early-2000s' pop-punk acts such as Avril Lavigne, "2 MINUS 1" is an exercise in post-breakup denial, with Joshua and Vernon declaring they're definitely doing great, and they're not lonely at all, and they absolutely don't need their former lover anymore. The lyrics cleverly weave such statements with bitter accusations and more honest hints at their true feelings, all wrapped up in a clean track that could easily slip into any early '00s pop-punk playlist.

It's a sound many of us know and love, and SEVENTEEN pull it off beautifully.

10. "Another Life" by KEY

It's an undisputed fact that SHINee are K-pop royalty. Debuting in 2008, the phenomenally popular boy group has accumulated a deluge of achievements and accolades over their storied career, both together and as solo artists.

"Another Life" by SHINee's KEY demonstrates how almost 15 years in the industry has sharpened the performer's skill to a razor's edge. A synthwave dance bop, "Another Life" is a love song that invokes images of travelling to Atlantis or blasting into outer space, tying into the retro creature feature inspiration of KEY's 2022 album Gasoline.

It's a dynamic tune with a catchy chorus, energetic beat, and tempting replay button.

11. "WHO DO YOU LOVE?" by Monsta X (feat. French Montana)

Not content with just one or two offerings, boy group Monsta X treated Western fans to an entire album completely filled with English-language songs in 2020. ALL ABOUT LUV is packed with pleasing tunes on the themes of romance, love, and lust, ranging from the longing to be longed for in "SOMEONE'S SOMEONE," to the bitterness of seeing an ex "HAPPY WITHOUT ME," to staying up thinking about a lover in "MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT."

It's difficult to pick a standout when you're so spoiled for choice, but lead single "WHO DO YOU LOVE? (feat. French Montana)" is a good place to start as one of the catchiest songs on the album. Just skip over the part where French Montana raps. We're not claiming that.

ALL ABOUT LUV also has a few slightly more risque songs such as booty call bid "GOT MY NUMBER" and the deceptively innocent-sounding "LOVE U," whose suggestive lyrics I was absolutely not prepared for ("I really, really wanna love you / But I can't say the word I want to / 'Cause they won't play it on the radio").

12. "Can’t get you out of my mind" by Dreamcatcher

Good news for anyone who desperately missed the early 2010's club scene: Dreamcatcher's EDM track "Can’t get you out of my mind" will effortlessly pull you right back there, complete with sick bass drop.

A B-side quietly nestled in Dreamcatcher's 2020 mini-album Dystopia: Lose Myself, "Can't get you out of my mind" may have been easy to miss upon its initial release. The fact that it came out during the COVID-19 pandemic likely didn't help either, with lockdowns impacting both dance venues and promotion opportunities.

This is unfortunate, because the girl group's first English-language song is a banger that wouldn't feel out of place on any good club playlist. This is a great tune for when you don't want to think, just dance.

13. "Zombie" by DAY6

DAY6 are a bit different from the other K-pop artists on this list, as they're a band rather than a group. This means that rather than spectacular, highly choreographed group dances, the members play instruments on stage — so not quite what you'd usually picture when someone says "K-pop." But that just means you won't have as much to distract you from their songs' lyrics.

"Zombie" isn't quite as uptempo as DAY6's previous single "Sweet Chaos," which would definitely have been on this list if it were in English. Rather, the downbeat 2020 pop-rock song focuses on depression, likening the unfortunately relatable feeling of numbness to being a zombie. I hope it doesn't hit a chord with you, but it probably will.

14. "Pity Party" by Jamie

Jamie's "Pity Party" is an attitude-filled anthem for self-destruction, bringing out the After School Club host's sultry, "toxic" side. This is one for those nights you know you'll probably regret, but just can't bring yourself to care.

"Pity Party" does acknowledge that once you've hit rock bottom "the only way is up," threading Jamie's repetitive yet appealing 2022 groove with savage determination. However, that's largely a problem for Future Jamie. In the meantime, the primary focus of "Pity Party" is taking the moment to revel in the dark freedom and dramatic spectacle of being so low.

"Thriving off the drama" may not technically be the healthiest or most constructive stance to take in most situations. But you can't deny it is deliciously fun.

15. "Somebody" by Wonho

The lyrics of Wonho's 2022 song "Somebody" are all about loneliness, with the singer crying out for "a shoulder to lean on" when alone at night. Yet despite the desolate subject matter, the song itself is a groovy bop with a steady, catchy rhythm that belies its topic. Being desperately lonely shouldn't sound so good.

Wonho's clear vocals and attractive falsetto are underscored by an enjoyably strong bass line running throughout "Somebody," mirroring his adorably soft personality and famously jacked build.

I have never met Wonho and probably never will. That being said, he seems like a very sweet man and I hope he finds somebody soon.

16. "Borderline" by SUNMI

"Borderline" hits you as soon as SUNMI opens her mouth, crooning "I'm trying to be a good girl / Didn't mean to fake it." Co-written by SUNMI herself, this dark 2020 tune is about the former Wonder Girls member's experiences with borderline personality disorder, having been diagnosed with the condition in the mid-2010s.

"It's my story that I've hidden for a long time," SUNMI said in English-translated comments. Though she previously kept her borderline personality disorder a secret, SUNMI shared that she now wanted to tell others who are struggling that they aren't alone.

As such, the languid, personal song seems almost disinterested in popular appeal. Rather, it's more concerned with conveying SUNMI’s personal struggles in an almost ambient manner, her hypnotic voice effectively luring listeners in to form a connection.

17. "neon" by Amber Liu (feat. PENIEL)

While Amber began her career as the main rapper for K-pop girl group f(x), she's now arguably more known for her solo work, having shown off her vocal skills in multiple Korean, English, and Mandarin songs since 2015. As such, Amber now has an extensive English-language discography to choose from, with various songs such as "Other People," "On My Own (feat. Gen Neo)," and "complicated" falling across a wide spectrum of melancholy.

Light 2021 bop "neon" gives Amber the opportunity to show off her vocal skills in a decidedly more optimistic setting, with Peniel from boy group BTOB taking the reins for the English version's rap (Blow Fever takes on this role in the Mandarin version). Resting comfortably in its chill pop disco vibe, "neon" is a smooth, enjoyable jam with a music video that was definitely a ton of fun to film.

18. "No Problem" by Nayeon (feat. Felix from Stray Kids)

TWICE's lead vocalist Nayeon made her solo debut in 2022, filling her album Im Nayeon with love songs to compliment her bubbly lead single "POP!" Among these was "No Problem," an entirely English-language song featuring her labelmate Felix from Stray Kids.

An uncomplicated song about bolstering your partner when they're feeling down, "No Problem" is a characteristically cute little bop that embraces its simple and straightforward nature. It isn't necessarily groundbreaking, but sits comfortably as a bright palate cleanser between "POP!" and the rest of Nayeon's album.

Though Nayeon's group member Tzuyu released a playful cover of Taylor Swift's "ME!" with Stray Kids' Bang Chan in 2021, "No Problem" is the first time members from both groups have collaborated on an original English-language performance.

19. "Bonnie & Clyde" by YUQI

I told myself I'd stop, but just let me just squeeze in one more song.

(G)I-DLE member YUQI only had two songs on her 2021 solo debut album A Page, which may indicate just how confident she was in them. "Giant" and "Bonnie & Clyde" were also English-language releases, with YUQI's album eschewing both Korean and her native Mandarin entirely.

The lyrics of "Bonnie & Clyde" tread familiar territory, focusing on a passionate couple who are completely wrapped up in each other to the exclusion of all else — much like the titular criminal couple. Even so, YUQI's low, steady vocal performance and the song's relentless, trance-like melody make "Bonnie & Clyde" an appealing tune that deftly showcases the singer's skill.

It's worth keeping in mind that this is just a small selection of songs from K-pop idols that were released in English first as opposed to Korean. There's an even wider catalogue of English versions of Korean songs, such as ITZY's "LOCO" and Pentagon's "DO or NOT."

Yet even this is minuscule when compared to the entire universe of tunes you can enjoy once you relax and embrace Korean lyrics. Don't worry if you don't understand what they're singing 100 percent of the time — you can always look up translations. Besides, sometimes all you need to know is the vibe.
K-pop is full of fantastic tunes, feel-good bops, and certified bangers that anyone can enjoy, regardless of their proficiency with the Korean language. Even so, diving into the world of South Korean pop music can be intimidating to English speakers who are accustomed to understanding all of a song's lyrics.

Fortunately, you don't have to jump straight to songs with Korean lyrics in order to start exploring K-pop. Many K-pop artists have released English-language tunes that allow you to familiarise yourself with the performers and their sound before plunging into their wider discography. This has become increasingly common in recent years, as K-pop's global reach expands and idols seek to attract and cater to new audiences.

A lot of these releases are also just fantastic songs by themselves, regardless of whether you're interested in investigating K-pop any further.

In no particular order, here are some of the best English-language songs from K-pop idols.

1. "Love Talk" by WayV

This list is strictly limited to songs by K-pop idols that aren't just English-language versions of previous Korean releases. "Love Talk" by WayV was initially in Mandarin, so it doesn't count.

Released one week after the original Mandarin song, 2019's "Love Talk" is a smooth jam about an attraction between people who don't speak the same language. The alluring melody satisfyingly recalls '90s R&B and offers an appealing contrast between the seductive chorus and steady rap. This has won its music video almost 75 million views in under three years and over 107 million streams on Spotify.

You could justifiably argue that "Love Talk" isn't a K-pop song, as Mandarin is obviously not Korean. However, WayV is the Chinese subunit of K-pop group NCT, making the artists themselves K-pop idols. This means they clearly satisfy the arbitrary requirements for inclusion on this list that I made up. Besides, I wasn't about to leave "Love Talk" out. It's just too good to not recommend.

2. "LMLY" by Jackson Wang

"LMLY" by Jackson Wang is severely underrated, and I will continue to speak my truth until this retro '80s tune gets the attention it deserves.

Jackson has kept himself busy since he and his K-pop group GOT7 left JYP Entertainment, collaborating with artists such as RAIN, continuing to run his label Team Wang, and forming hip-hop group PANTHEPACK. While he is still working with GOT7, Jackson has also gone in hard on English-language solo work, experimenting with an entire spectrum of musical genres across songs such as "Blow" and "Cruel."

Yet out of all of this, it was the idol's 2021 nostalgic synth-pop tune "LMLY" that had me setting its Hong Kong cinema-inspired music video on loop. An acronym of "Leave Me Loving You," "LMLY" is a wistful song about the singer's fear that their lover is losing interest in them. "You don't call me baby / You call me my name," Jackson mourns. "But I keep on hoping / Nothing has changed." Like, ouch.

3. "The Feels" by TWICE

Do you love feel-good bops? Energetic, colourful performances? Addictive, appealing dances that are fun to learn yourself? Well then, please allow me to introduce you to your next nine girlfriends.

"The Feels" is the first original English-language single from hugely popular girl group TWICE, who have enjoyed massive success in South Korea and Japan for years. This solid, sweet 2021 love song about having "the feels" is a great introduction to TWICE for Western ears, offering a taste of the bright, catchy, optimistic tunes these seasoned performers excel at. Their sound certainly has an audience as well, with the music video racking up over 320 million views in just over a year.

If you're after more of TWICE's cute yet mature sound, the group has also released English versions of their Korean songs "More and More" and "I Can't Stop Me." You can't go too wrong wherever you start though — their entire discography is filled with tunes that will stick in your head and steal your heart.

4. "Dream of You" by CHUNG HA (with R3HAB)

"Dream of You" was a mandatory addition to this list, and I regret nothing. CHUNG HA's 2020 collaboration with R3HAB delivers a satisfyingly unapologetic banger, dripping with confidence and a highly danceable beat. CHUNG HA demands attention, irresistibly drawing all eyes and ears to her, and she knows it. This is one I've had on repeat, and I need you all to join me.

A sexually charged club song about enticing a lover into bed, "Dream of You" is also much more forward than the casual K-pop listener might expect. CHUNG HA paints a vivid picture of inviting her paramour back to her place, and isn't shy about what's likely to happen once they're alone.

"What can I say? Park the car and come on in / I got whisky, I got gin, and lingerie," sings CHUNG HA.

5. "Kiss of fire" by WOODZ

Technically "Kiss of fire" isn't entirely in English. Soloist WOODZ does throw in the tiniest pinch of Korean during the second verse, brief enough that you might miss it unless you know it's there. Still, 99 percent of the song's lyrics are in English, which feels like enough to let it sneak onto this list. I will make whatever excuses I need to for this excellent jam.

The Korean lyrics in "Kiss of fire" also won't prevent listeners who don't understand the language from understanding the song. Released in 2021, "Kiss of fire" is a contemporary R&B track about hot, burning love, with WOODZ flexing his falsetto to deliver a charismatic vocal performance over a rhythmic bass line.

If you're more interested in rock, WOODZ's "Dirt on my leather" is also worth checking out for an incredibly different vibe.

6. "Sweet Night" by V

BTS cemented their place in the Western music scene with English-language singles "Dynamite," "Butter," and "Permission to Dance," all of which are upbeat tunes that primarily endeavour to spread good vibes. (Don't pretend you haven't heard them. Ignorance and lies have never won anyone respect.) In contrast, "Sweet Night" by V strikes such a different tone that you'd have no idea he was a member of BTS unless you were told.

Recorded for the original soundtrack of 2020 Korean drama Itaewon Class, "Sweet Night" is a comforting, gentle acoustic song that's just as sweet as its title implies. V's soothing voice is complimented by Matilda Mann's pure backup vocals, and the whistled refrain leading out "Sweet Night" emphasises its simple, clean melody. It isn't difficult to understand how the music video has earned over 86 million views at time of writing. Pair this song with a quiet night and a warm cup of tea.

7. "Oh my god" by (G)I-DLE

(G)I-DLE's dark, ambiguously sapphic 2020 single "Oh my god" was released simultaneously in Korean and English — though only the former got the benefit of its visually striking music video, which accumulated 184 million views in a year and a half. Fortunately, fans took it upon themselves to edit the English audio on top of the Korean clip, so you can still get the full experience.

Though (G)I-DLE's trap-pop song is officially about love in all its forms, gay K-pop fans have embraced "Oh my god" as a "lesbian anthem," citing its liberal use of female pronouns as well as its religious imagery.

Also, just all of the lyrics. Listen to songwriter Soyeon sing "can't stop, girl, you make me sick" and try telling me "Oh my god" isn't queer coded with a straight face.

8. "Life's Too Short" by aespa

This 2022 song threw me right back to the pastel-coloured early '00s, strongly reminding me of the girl groups that used to populate my beloved Barbie-branded compilation CDs. Offering a laid back, nostalgic pop sound, "Life's Too Short" is an unbothered message to aespa's detractors — or anyone who sets out to put others down.

"I'm doin' me regardless," aespa declare. "And I don't care what you say about it / And it don't matter if you like it or not / I'm having all this fun, so why would I ever stop?"

Earning almost 50 million views in just under four months, "Life's Too Short" is a self-affirming song with sweet harmonies that hearken back to the simpler times of butterfly clips and gel pens.

9. "2 MINUS 1" by SEVENTEEN

Though credited to SEVENTEEN as a whole, "2 MINUS 1" only features the 13-member boy group's two most fluent English speakers: Joshua and Vernon. These members were also on the writing team for "2 MINUS 1," which became the first completely English-language song in SEVENTEEN's discography upon its release in 2021.

Inspired by early-2000s' pop-punk acts such as Avril Lavigne, "2 MINUS 1" is an exercise in post-breakup denial, with Joshua and Vernon declaring they're definitely doing great, and they're not lonely at all, and they absolutely don't need their former lover anymore. The lyrics cleverly weave such statements with bitter accusations and more honest hints at their true feelings, all wrapped up in a clean track that could easily slip into any early '00s pop-punk playlist.

It's a sound many of us know and love, and SEVENTEEN pull it off beautifully.

10. "Another Life" by KEY

It's an undisputed fact that SHINee are K-pop royalty. Debuting in 2008, the phenomenally popular boy group has accumulated a deluge of achievements and accolades over their storied career, both together and as solo artists.

"Another Life" by SHINee's KEY demonstrates how almost 15 years in the industry has sharpened the performer's skill to a razor's edge. A synthwave dance bop, "Another Life" is a love song that invokes images of travelling to Atlantis or blasting into outer space, tying into the retro creature feature inspiration of KEY's 2022 album Gasoline.

It's a dynamic tune with a catchy chorus, energetic beat, and tempting replay button.

11. "WHO DO YOU LOVE?" by Monsta X (feat. French Montana)

Not content with just one or two offerings, boy group Monsta X treated Western fans to an entire album completely filled with English-language songs in 2020. ALL ABOUT LUV is packed with pleasing tunes on the themes of romance, love, and lust, ranging from the longing to be longed for in "SOMEONE'S SOMEONE," to the bitterness of seeing an ex "HAPPY WITHOUT ME," to staying up thinking about a lover in "MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT."

It's difficult to pick a standout when you're so spoiled for choice, but lead single "WHO DO YOU LOVE? (feat. French Montana)" is a good place to start as one of the catchiest songs on the album. Just skip over the part where French Montana raps. We're not claiming that.

ALL ABOUT LUV also has a few slightly more risque songs such as booty call bid "GOT MY NUMBER" and the deceptively innocent-sounding "LOVE U," whose suggestive lyrics I was absolutely not prepared for ("I really, really wanna love you / But I can't say the word I want to / 'Cause they won't play it on the radio").

12. "Can’t get you out of my mind" by Dreamcatcher

Good news for anyone who desperately missed the early 2010's club scene: Dreamcatcher's EDM track "Can’t get you out of my mind" will effortlessly pull you right back there, complete with sick bass drop.

A B-side quietly nestled in Dreamcatcher's 2020 mini-album Dystopia: Lose Myself, "Can't get you out of my mind" may have been easy to miss upon its initial release.

This means that rather than spectacular, highly choreographed group dances, the members play instruments on stage — so not quite what you'd usually picture when someone says "K-pop." But that just means you won't have as much to distract you from their songs' lyrics.

"Zombie" isn't quite as uptempo as DAY6's previous single "Sweet Chaos," which would definitely have been on this list if it were in English. Rather, the downbeat 2020 pop-rock song focuses on depression, likening the unfortunately relatable feeling of numbness to being a zombie. I hope it doesn't hit a chord with you, but it probably will.

14. "Pity Party" by Jamie

Jamie's "Pity Party" is an attitude-filled anthem for self-destruction, bringing out the After School Club host's sultry, "toxic" side. This is one for those nights you know you'll probably regret, but just can't bring yourself to care.

"Pity Party" does acknowledge that once you've hit rock bottom "the only way is up," threading Jamie's repetitive yet appealing 2022 groove with savage determination. However, that's largely a problem for Future Jamie. In the meantime, the primary focus of "Pity Party" is taking the moment to revel in the dark freedom and dramatic spectacle of being so low.

"Thriving off the drama" may not technically be the healthiest or most constructive stance to take in most situations. But you can't deny it is deliciously fun.

15. "Somebody" by Wonho

The lyrics of Wonho's 2022 song "Somebody" are all about loneliness, with the singer crying out for "a shoulder to lean on" when alone at night. Yet despite the desolate subject matter, the song itself is a groovy bop with a steady, catchy rhythm that belies its topic. Being desperately lonely shouldn't sound so good.

Wonho's clear vocals and attractive falsetto are underscored by an enjoyably strong bass line running throughout "Somebody," mirroring his adorably soft personality and famously jacked build.

I have never met Wonho and probably never will. That being said, he seems like a very sweet man and I hope he finds somebody soon.

16. "Borderline" by SUNMI

"Borderline" hits you as soon as SUNMI opens her mouth, crooning "I'm trying to be a good girl / Didn't mean to fake it." Co-written by SUNMI herself, this dark 2020 tune is about the former Wonder Girls member's experiences with borderline personality disorder, having been diagnosed with the condition in the mid-2010s.

"It's my story that I've hidden for a long time," SUNMI said in English-translated comments. Though she previously kept her borderline personality disorder a secret, SUNMI shared that she now wanted to tell others who are struggling that they aren't alone.

As such, the languid, personal song seems almost disinterested in popular appeal. Rather, it's more concerned with conveying SUNMI’s personal struggles in an almost ambient manner, her hypnotic voice effectively luring listeners in to form a connection.

17. "neon" by Amber Liu (feat. PENIEL)

While Amber began her career as the main rapper for K-pop girl group f(x), she's now arguably more known for her solo work, having shown off her vocal skills in multiple Korean, English, and Mandarin songs since 2015. As such, Amber now has an extensive English-language discography to choose from, with various songs such as "Other People," "On My Own (feat.

It isn't necessarily groundbreaking, but sits comfortably as a bright palate cleanser between "POP!" and the rest of Nayeon's album.

Though Nayeon's group member Tzuyu released a playful cover of Taylor Swift's "ME!" with Stray Kids' Bang Chan in 2021, "No Problem" is the first time members from both groups have collaborated on an original English-language performance.

19. "Bonnie & Clyde" by YUQI

I told myself I'd stop, but just let me just squeeze in one more song.

(G)I-DLE member YUQI only had two songs on her 2021 solo debut album A Page, which may indicate just how confident she was in them. "Giant" and "Bonnie & Clyde" were also English-language releases, with YUQI's album eschewing both Korean and her native Mandarin entirely.

Where did Wordle come from?

Wordle was initially created by engineer Josh Wardle as a gift for his partner, though it quickly spread until it became an international phenomenon. Thousands of players across the globe tackle Wordle each day, with some fans even having created alternate versions of the daily word puzzle game. These include battle royale format Squabble, music identification game Heardle, and variations like Dordle and Quordle that make you guess multiple words at once.

The popularity of Wordle even reached such heights that the New York Times bought it earlier this year, while TikTok creators live-stream themselves playing it.

What's the best Wordle starting word?

The goal of Wordle is to have fun, and there's no right way to have fun. Just choose whatever starting word feels right to you, and don't let anyone shame you for it. However, if you want to take a more strategic approach, we have a few ideas to help you pick a word that will spark joy. One tip is to select a word that includes at least two different vowels, plus some common consonants like S, T, R, or N.

What happened to the Wordle archive?

The entire archive of past Wordles used to be available for anyone to play in glorious days gone by. Unfortunately it has since been taken down, with the website's creator stating it was done at the request of the New York Times.

Is Wordle getting harder?

If you're finding Wordle too easy, you can try enabling its Hard Mode to give your brain a tougher challenge. But Wordle isn't getting any harder by itself — it's the same difficulty that it's always been.

Why are there two different Wordle answers some days?

Wordle is a fun, collective experience specifically because everyone's solving for the same word every day. Occasionally, though, Wordle has accepted two different solutions as correct on the same day. This is because the New York Times made changes to the Wordle word list after acquiring it, and sometimes swaps out words from the original list. To ensure you're getting the right answer every day, refresh your browser before you play — the site will save your streak.

Here's a subtle hint for today's Wordle answer:

Taylor Swift has quietly edited the music video for her new single "Anti-Hero" on Apple Music, removing a shot that some viewers found fatphobic. The change also inadvertently made it a stronger video.

Released on Oct. 21, Taylor Swift's album Midnights was eagerly received by fans and quickly broke two Spotify records. However, her latest pop offering didn't arrive without criticism. In particular, the music video for Swift's lead single "Anti-Hero", which she wrote and directed, received negative attention for a scene in which she stands on a set of bathroom scales while another version of her looks on. Rather than showing a number, the scales simply read "FAT" — an image that some viewers considered fatphobic due to it associating fatness with undesirability.

While Swift hasn't spoken publicly on the criticism, it appears she has taken notice. The "Anti-Hero" video has now been altered on Apple Music to remove the controversial shot, instead showing Swift stepping onto the scales before her alter-ego leans over to read it and shake her head disapprovingly.

Despite this change on Apple Music, the "Anti-Hero" video hasn't been updated across all platforms. Swift's music video still includes the "FAT" scales on YouTube, likely attributable to the fact that the platform doesn't allow such edits to videos that have already been uploaded.

YouTube creators can trim clips that have already gone live, but inserting those extra few seconds of Taylor judging Taylor would require the "Anti-Hero" music video be deleted then reuploaded in its entirety. This would completely erase its still-rising 34 million view count, which is a number both Swift and Republic Records would no doubt rather keep. Apple Music doesn't publicly display such statistics.

It's reasonable to assume the change to "Anti-Hero" was due to the unfavourable response to Swift's original video. Even so, the removal of the controversial shot arguably strengthens the overall product. Without the word "FAT" glaring up at the audience, the more subtle implication is that it doesn't really matter what the scale says — her critical second self will be dissatisfied no matter what.

Swift has previously been open about dealing with an eating disorder, most notably in her 2020 documentary Miss Americana.

While altering digital products after their release has long been the norm in video games, it has become increasingly common in other media as well. Other high profile examples include both Lizzo and Beyonce changing song lyrics to remove ableist language in response to fan feedback earlier this year.

Taylor Swift has quietly edited the music video for her new single "Anti-Hero" on Apple Music, removing a shot that some viewers found fatphobic. The change also inadvertently made it a stronger video.

Reddit is often called "the front page of the internet," where users post all sorts of links and stories to what's happening around the world. But this week, Reddit itself was thrust into the spotlight after a fake post on the platform became part of a high-profile trial being livestreamed to an audience of millions.

Darrell Brooks, the man accused of intentionally plowing his SUV into a Christmas parade in Waukesha, Wisconsin and killing 6 people in November 2021, has been found guilty of six counts of first degree-intentional homicide and dozens of other charges including multiple counts of reckless endangerment.

The bizarre weeks-long trial included the defendant Brooks firing his lawyer, acting as his own attorney, and cross-examining witnesses who were injured in the attack. At one point during the trial, Brooks claimed he was a "sovereign citizen," arguing that he believed the laws of the U.S. did not apply to him. He also regularly argued with Judge Jennifer Dorow over regular court processes.

However, none of Brooks' antics could match up to the strange social media events that attempted to derail the trial just one day before the jury reached its verdict.

On Tuesday, someone claiming to be a juror in the Darrell Brooks trial posted to Reddit, basically giving any user on the social media platform an open invitation to add their input about the trial. The post drew immediate attention not only because jurors are prohibited from using social media during the trial, but also because the anonymous user posted it in a subreddit called r/Justice4Darrell with less than a thousand followers. Prior to the juror's post, this small subreddit appeared to mostly consist of trolls feigning support for Brooks.

"I obviously shouldn't be here," read the post. "I'm not allowed to look stuff up about this trial (or really have any connection with the Internet, but nobody actually follows sequestering rules anyway). Hence I am obviously posting anonymously."

The user went on to explain that though they believed Brooks committed the crime, they didn't believe he was given a fair trial. The Redditor then brought up the idea of jury nullification, which is when a jury returns a "not guilty" verdict in cases where they want to send a message about the law.

A moderator of the subreddit claimed the user provided proof, privately, that they were indeed a juror in the trial. The post's comments then quickly filled up with some users questioning its legitimacy while others were outraged that the supposed juror would jeopardize the trial by posting on social media at all.

Nevertheless, the Reddit post actually made it to the trial as multiple individuals forwarded it to authorities. Judge Dorow addressed the existence of the post but also questioned its legitimacy. The judge explained that it had been passed on to law enforcement to look into, but that it would not change the proceedings in the trial.

Not long after, the Redditor who claimed to be a juror came clean. It was indeed fake.

"This was all a prank, I didn't think this would blow up like this. We are sorry. Love, rdrama," read the edited post.

The Darrell Brooks trial has received a significant amount of attention online. From the start, right-wing pundits and personalities paid special interest to the case, attempting to tie Darrell Brooks to the Black Lives Matter movement. The live courtroom video network Law & Crime's coverage of the trial proceedings have, to date, amassed millions of views on YouTube. Tuesday's verdict watch livestream alone has already racked up more than 2.5 million views. On TikTok, the Darrell Brooks topic page shows that videos about the defendant have received more than 600 million views, with some users explaining how their interest in the case came from TikTok's For You Page recommendations.

It seems very clear that a legal event with so many eyeballs watching would inevitably attract some bad actors.

Despite the AMA's inauthenticity, Brooks unsuccessfully tried to make the argument that the Reddit post should result in a mistrial. Brooks pointed to the juror's knowledge of the case in an attempt to cast the post as legitimate, before being reminded that the trial was being broadcast online all over the world. As prosecutors explained , the edit on the post occurred during a time when the jury was deliberating and did not have access to their phones or any internet-connected devices. Thus, the Redditor behind the post could not have been a juror.

As of Wednesday, the subreddit r/Justice4Darrell has been banned from the Reddit platform.

While the fake juror's Reddit post never actually threatened a mistrial, it was taken seriously enough to become part of the official courtroom proceedings. And though it only resulted in temporarily hijacking the trial, it will surely prove an enticing blueprint for other trolls to attempt.

In the future, perhaps a similar fake post will be much harder to debunk and actually derail a trial. One thing is for sure, it certainly won't be the last time this happens.

People on TikTok are using tracks from Taylor Swift's Midnights to talk their talk and go viral.

Swift's tenth studio album, Midnights, has been out for less than a week, and it's already taking over TikTok. However, the most popular tracks on the platform may or may not surprise you.

Here are the eight most popular songs off Midnights, according to TikTok. (This list is based on the number of videos posted for each song.)

1. "Anti-Hero"

Unsurprisingly, the album's lead single — and the track with arguably the most viral lyrics — is causing the biggest stir on TikTok with a whopping 84,000 videos and counting. The song's vulnerable, yet humorous lyrics and its Swift-directed music video have inspired thousands of fan edits and lyrical analysis videos. Not to mention, "It's me. Hi. I'm the problem it's me" is perfectly designed for users to share the ways in which they are the problem — something we know they love to do.

2. "Karma"

Coming in second with over 24,000 videos is "Karma." The undeniable bop has Swifties dancing and lip-synching along to the catchy track, which features very Swiftian lyrics like, "Karma is a cat, purring in my lap 'cause it loves me."

3. "Midnight Rain"

Despite its uncharacteristic production (how much pitched-down vocal modulation is too much vocal modulation?), "Midnight Rain" is another fan favorite. Listeners are picking up on the tragically mismatched couple depicted in the lyrics and making fan edits of similarly ill-fated fictional couples like Little Women's Jo and Laurie.

4. "Vigilante Shit"

Perhaps the most controversial track on the record, "Vigilante Shit" has TikTokkers split between poking fun at Swift's dramatic lyrics, like "draw the cat eyes sharp enough to kill a man," and embracing the song in all its cringiness. Users have also taken inspiration from Swift's "Vigilante Shit" TikTok and are posting transition videos of them "dressing for revenge."

5. "You're On Your Own, Kid"

"You're On Your Own, Kid" is track five of Midnights, and as any Swiftie knows, Swift's track fives are always the most emotionally devastating song on each album. If the over 17,000 TikToks are anything to go by, "You're On Your Own, Kid" did not disappoint. Users have honed in on the lyric, "So make the friendship bracelets, take the moment and taste it" and are posting sweet montages of themselves and their friends.

6. "Bejeweled"

The second single off Midnights is a favorite for lip-synching, dancing, and blinging transition videos.

7. "Lavender Haze"

"Lavender Haze" was our collective introduction to Midnights, and as the first track on the album it seems to be the go-to song for any TikTok loosely related to the release and the pop star. It's become the soundtrack to a truly eclectic mix of videos, from Midnights-inspired drink recipes to Midnights-inspired Instagram captions.

8. "Mastermind"

In "Mastermind," Swift describes how she plotted to ensure someone (Joe Alwyn) would fall in love with her. The track made many fans feel so seen that they've gotten on TikTok to expose the crazy schemes they concocted to get close to someone.

They came as soon as Elon Musk announced he was buying Twitter. A wave of tweets from users dramatically proclaiming they would leave Twitter if/when the deal went through.

Thanks to the drama being prolonged by Musk first reneging on the acquisition, then changing his mind to follow through on his original intent to buy Twitter, for months, the social media platform has been awash with tweets making this smug threat. As a Person Who Uses the Internet, I'm begging you, please stop. No one cares. I'm not the only one. Now, a search for "leaving Twitter" turns up just as many tweets from people annoyed about this declaration as the declaration itself, and not just right-wing users who are gloating.

To be clear, I'm not asking people to not leave Twitter. It makes sense that people want to leave the platform if Musk buys it. A polarizing public figure who has a history of making inflammatory statements, Musk says he sees Twitter as "the digital town square," and wants to limit censorship in order to foster free speech. But the billionaire who openly disdains "woke" progressives, and was charged with fraud by the Securities and Exchange Commission for his misleading tweets, doesn't instill confidence that his vision for a civil utopian online forum are genuine, or even feasible. Twitter is already rampant with bots and misinformation. Removing content moderation measures might make it even worse.

So if you want to leave Twitter, I get it. Just stop tweeting about it.

If you're expecting to be rewarded for proudly announcing your moral integrity, it's not gonna happen. Twitter is an immoral place where bad behavior is what gets rewarded with attention. If you're hoping your tweet goes viral, which it won't because Twitter is already saturated with this claim, what do you care? You'll be off Twitter anyways, so you won't even see it. Unless you stay on Twitter, or sneak back on, which is even worse since it kind of undermines the whole point of your public statement. Plus, it's hard not to notice the irony of leveraging the platform to announce that you're leaving the platform. If you're worried about people being able to keep in touch, don't worry. Your online presence follows you everywhere, Twitter following or not.

When you tweet that you're leaving Twitter, you're limited to two options: Become a hypocrite if you end up staying on Twitter, or feed the political narrative about outrage culture that conservative Twitter is currently relishing with glee. Instead, Mashable senior reporter Christianna Silva proposes an alternative. If you're going to leave Twitter, "disappear and say nothing. Let me have a mystery." The mysterious disappearance of your Twitter activity is more likely to garner some attention than any heavy-handed farewell, which — just admit it — was your goal all along.

Elon Musk might not officially be the head of Twitter just yet, but he's certainly taking his victory lap already.

In the latest twist in a constantly evolving saga, Musk posted corny jokes on Twitter on Wednesday, seemingly celebrating the fact that he'd bought the social media giant before this Friday's purchase deadline.

To wit: Musk posted a video carrying a literal, physical sink into the Twitter offices. "Entering Twitter HQ – let that sink in!" he wrote. Yes, it's a pun. A very bad pun. And a very old internet joke, like lots of other Musk posts.

In the video, Musk repeats the joke, laughing while saying, "You just can't help but let that sink in."

In a sign further indicating his purchase has gone through or is set to go through, Musk also changed his Twitter bio to read: "Chief Twit."

So...it appears this thing is actually happening? Maybe?

It has certainly been a long, strange saga.

In April, Musk placed a $44 billion bid to take over the company and then promptly put the deal "on hold" just a month later, claiming he was concerned the platform was riddled with fake accounts. He then tried to back out of the deal completely. Predictably, Twitter sued Musk.

Earlier this month, it was reported that Musk had reversed course and would now be willing to buy the company again ahead of a court date. It seemed the drama had mercifully ceased, but then word got out Musk floated the idea of firing 75 percent of Twitter's workforce, causing employees of the company to reportedly draft an open letter criticizing the idea.

So...it's unlikely he received a heroes' welcome entering the offices, even with his...um...brilliant sink joke.

Musk has an almost impressive devotion to posting; he posts corny jokes, his latest thoughts, and some truly awful things. But he's always posting. The guy has an unfathomable amount of money — he could spend the rest of his days doing literally anything he could imagine and yet he just keeps posting to Twitter.

It shouldn't be any surprise that the first real news of the deal being maybe, sorta official was a Musk pun brought to life. The billionaire literally carried a sink into an office to make a bad, old joke. And he did this while going into an office where he apparently plans to can three out of every four people he sees.

We live in strange times.

We live in strange times.
A mere two weeks ago, we promised you that Meta's VR legs weren't real and couldn't hurt you. Well, it turns out we were wrong... kinda. Though Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg's much-ballyhooed avatar legs aren't yet available in the metaverse, there was a pair floating around the toy section of a Florida Walmart last week.

The tiny plastic gams were created by Legboot, a 33-year-old software engineer from Florida who moonlights as a professional shitposter and "bootleg artist." He's quite prolific, with past projects ranging from a disappointed adult Steve from Blue Clues action figure to a portrait of Charmander as Alexander Hamilton and even a Shrek Supreme hat.

After seeing that Zuckerberg was being roasted online for calling avatar legs “probably the most requested feature on our roadmap," Legboot decided to make them a reality. He grabbed a cheap plastic figure off of Chinese ecommerce site Alibaba, "chopped his legs off," and painted them a shade of Meta blue.

The packaging notes that the legs are indeed the first in a series of "Most Wanted Features of the Metaverse" toys. And, according to the box, you can "sit chair," "sit desk," "squatch bug," "can-can," and "check floor for wood rot" with these non-VR stems.

If that all sounds like garbled English, well, it's on purpose. Legboot intentionally mangled internet meme-speak for the packaging, but noted that it added to the bit in other another way: "Sometimes I do try to... make stuff sound like it was a bootleg product produced in China and translated badly."

So is Legboot a fan of the metaverse? Not really.

"Someone gave me a really cheap-o knockoff [VR] headset where you can put your phone in it. I played around with that for a day."

To be fair, a cheap phone-based headset is not exactly the kind of future Zuckerberg has invested billions into.

However, if you are a Meta fan and are interested in buying the legs for yourself, Legboot says you're SOL. He only made one pair of legs and doesn't plan on making more.

"I have to be careful [because] it's a grey area. Parody and fair use is hard to define." That's especially true when it comes to Meta branding and Zuckerberg's likeness.

So, in the end, we're all back where we were two weeks ago. Leg-less and disappointed.

The packaging notes that the legs are indeed the first in a series of "Most Wanted Features of the Metaverse" toys. And, according to the box, you can "sit chair," "sit desk," "squatch bug," "can-can," and "check floor for wood rot" with these non-VR stems.

If that all sounds like garbled English, well, it's on purpose. Legboot intentionally mangled internet meme-speak for the packaging, but noted that it added to the bit in other another way: "Sometimes I do try to... make stuff sound like it was a bootleg product produced in China and translated badly."

So is Legboot a fan of the metaverse? Not really.

"Someone gave me a really cheap-o knockoff [VR] headset where you can put your phone in it. I played around with that for a day."

To be fair, a cheap phone-based headset is not exactly the kind of future Zuckerberg has invested billions into.

However, if you are a Meta fan and are interested in buying the legs for yourself, Legboot says you're SOL. He only made one pair of legs and doesn't plan on making more.

"I have to be careful [because] it's a grey area. Parody and fair use is hard to define." That's especially true when it comes to Meta branding and Zuckerberg's likeness.

So, in the end, we're all back where we were two weeks ago. Leg-less and disappointed.
Huge news for the kids who grew up gaming: There are some cognitive benefits associated with children who play video games.

Children who played video games showed "enhanced cognitive performance" in comparison to children who did not play video games, according to a new study in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), a peer-reviewed medical journal published by the American Medical Association. Researchers studied 2,217 children and found that there were "blood oxygen level-dependent signal differences" associated with video gaming in regions of the brain that relate to tasks during inhibition control and working memory.

"These findings suggest that video gaming may be associated with improved cognitive abilities involving response inhibition and working memory and with alterations in underlying cortical pathways," the research stated.

This isn't the first study connecting cognitive analysis to children who play video games. Plenty of research has previously linked video gaming to increases in aggressive behavior in kids. But, after accounting for variables like prior aggression, studies have been pretty mixed; some say video games are good for kids, others, not so much.

The internet really, really wants Texas Sen. Ted Cruz to show up in Philadelphia for the upcoming World Series.

See Cruz — ostensibly a Houston Astros fan in the way most politicians perform the role of "sports" "fan" — got heckled by New York fans at a Yankees game during the American League Championship Series. The Astros advanced past New York to play the Philadelphia Phillies in the World Series. The internet, or at least the portion that doesn't like Cruz, which is...significant...wants a repeat performance of Cruz's embarrassment, but this time in Philly.

See, Philly fans have a reputation for being surly and inhospitable to outsiders and, well, they almost certainly would not take things easier on Cruz. In New York, Cruz was greeted with F-bombs, booing, and middle finger after middle finger. He we also reminded of his escape to Mexico during a massive Texas emergency and former President Donald Trump insulting his wife. Cruz has, of course, sucked up to Trump nevertheless.

A large segment of Twitter has long reveled in Cruz's humiliation and worked to prove his hypocrisies. Now it's just dying for him to go to Philly just to see what the hell happens.

OK, so, truth be told, I am a Philly sports fan. As a fan from that part of the world, the lazy thing to do here is to bring up how Philly once threw snowballs at Santa — it was 1968, and it was just some guy literally plucked from the stands — but I'll just say the city is extremely passionate about sports. It has a very rugged, F-you, us-versus-the-world vibe and that's exactly why it's beautiful. The sports stadiums, especially during big games, are places that are not welcoming to outsiders. Meanwhile, the Phillies are in the World Series on a miracle run and the Eagles are undefeated — suffice it to say, the fans are primed to get rowdy.

So it's no shock that the internet is hoping, praying, begging Cruz to walk into a ballpark filled with that energy. Hell, Philly fans are probably even more politically aware right now considering they're seeing countless ads for the high profile senatorial race between Dr. Oz and John Fetterman in Pennsylvania.

Even someone as high profile as MSNBC host Chris Hayes brought up the idea of Cruz going to Philly.

"If Ted Cruz really wants to be a man of the people, mix it up with the regular folk...I've got an idea," Hayes said on air. "I suggest he buy a ticket for Game Three of the World Series in Philadelphia next Monday and sit up in the stands with the real fans."

It would almost certainly be...quite the experience. The World Series begins on Friday, with the first game in Philadelphia being played on Monday. The internet waits eagerly to see if it happens.

On Monday, Apple released iOS 16.1 which included updates to its payment guidelines — and a major middle finger to Meta .

"Digital purchases for content that is experienced or consumed in an app, including buying advertisements to display in the same app (such as sales of 'boosts' for posts in a social media app) must use in-app purchase," the Apple update reads .

This means that all apps now have to use the in-app purchases tool for boosts and promoted posts, which will give Apple a 30 percent cut of all of those sales. As Gizmodo reported , this seems to be pretty obviously aimed directly at Meta.

Boosts and promoted posts are all over most apps. For instance, you likely see promoted tweets — in which a user can pay to have a tweet seen on more screens — on Twitter with a reasonable frequency. But for some time, it's been unclear if the app store can take a cut from boosts and promoted posts. Apps that sell virtual goods have to use the App Store's payment system, which comes with a fat service charge, but that hasn't always necessarily included boosts and promoted posts, so Meta could take payments and avoid Apple's fee. Now, that's over.

The only loophole around this hefty fee is for apps that are specifically designed for advertising.

"Apps for the sole purpose of allowing advertisers (persons or companies that advertise a product, service, or event) to purchase and manage advertising campaigns across media types (television, outdoor, websites, apps, etc.) do not need to use in-app purchase," Apple says.

This will undoubtedly enrage Meta but, hey, the Meta and Apple have always been hostile as hell to each other. This just adds fuel to the already massive bonfire that is their relationship.

Below is a breakdown of the legal methods you’ll have to use if you want to stream every NFL game you could possibly want in the 2022-2023 season, assuming you don’t have pay TV or an antenna.

In an interview with CNBC in July about streaming access to Sunday games, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said that he and his colleagues, “really believe these new platforms give us an ability to innovate where we are today,” and that they make games, “more available to our consumers, particularly the younger demographic, which is one that we really want to get to.”

After reading this how-to, we’ll leave it to you to decide if the NFL is accomplishing that goal.

What services let you stream the NFL?

Thanks to the NFL’s gargantuan $100 billion broadcast deal signed in 2021, your ability to stream the NFL is scattered across the low-cost streaming services Amazon Prime Video(opens in a new tab), Paramount+(opens in a new tab), ESPN+(opens in a new tab), and Peacock(opens in a new tab), which all boast small pockets of exclusive coverage. Plus you'll need access that you can only get from the traditional networks Fox and NBC, along with the NFL’s own NFL Network. The latter games must be streamed via one of the countless live TV streaming services whose price points rival pay TV. And of course the extremely pricey NFL Sunday Ticket(opens in a new tab) — available as a standalone streaming service via AT&T’s DIRECTV — is also a necessity if you want to watch it all.

By my rough math, the minimum monthly cost for a patchwork of services that add up to comprehensive NFL streaming access is $133.45. That will involve making six different monthly payments: $4.99 for Paramount+, $4.99 for Peacock, $35 for Sling Blue, $8.99 for Amazon Prime Video, $9.99 for ESPN+, and $69.49 for Sunday Ticket.

Here’s a breakdown of what you need, and when:

How to stream the NFL on weekdays

In the rare case that your team happens to be playing this week’s Thursday night game, Amazon Prime Video(opens in a new tab) ($8.99 per month) is mandatory. If it’s Monday night, the game will be on ESPN+(opens in a new tab) ($9.99 per month).

But most games are on Sundays, and that’s where things get complicated.

How to stream in-market Sunday games

If the game you want to watch is shown by the local broadcasters in your area — most often because your local team is playing, though that’s not always the case — you can usually watch it with a live TV streaming service. Live TV streaming services for football can include:

Which is the most cost-effective live TV streaming service for the NFL?

With many, many caveats, the streaming service that probably delivers the most NFL to your TV this season for the least money is Sling TV’s Blue(opens in a new tab) plan, which costs $35 per month, after a 50 percent discount on your first month (meaning your introductory month is only $17.50).

The reason this is the surest path to consumer satisfaction is that your $35 per month lets you stream your local networks, with the important exceptions of CBS and ABC. This gives you access to in-market games on NBC and Fox, plus the ones that air on the NFL Network. That’s a lot of televised football for $35. If you have Sling Blue, and you occasionally want to watch something on CBS, ABC, or ESPN, you can temporarily subscribe to Paramount+ for the CBS ones, or ESPN+ for the ABC and ESPN ones. This is in addition to the usual requirement that you pay up to Amazon and ESPN for their weekday coverage if you want to see that.

If this all sounds much too expensive, and you’re just looking for a smattering of live NFL games, some of the aforementioned cheaper streaming services have you covered. Paramount+(opens in a new tab) ($4.99 per month) shows in-market games that happen to air on CBS. Peacock Premium(opens in a new tab) ($4.99 per month), shows in-market games on NBC, along with nationally broadcast Sunday Night Football.

But here comes the biggest caveat of all: All of this is mostly useless for people who don’t live in their favorite team’s market.

Why you might still end up paying $69.49 per month for NFL Sunday Ticket

Let’s face it: There’s a good chance your local team is not your team. Every Sunday, tons of NFL fans are stuck watching the Jaguars, the Titans, or the Bengals, when they really want to see the Cowboys, the Raiders, or the Patriots. This is why pay TV providers have been making so much money from NFL Sunday Ticket ever since the 90s.

If you want to watch your team in the streaming era, NFL Sunday Ticket(opens in a new tab), the streaming service from DIRECTTV (which is distinct from DIRECTV Stream) is probably what you’re stuck with. It costs a lot of money, but it gets you access to a lot of football. It would be easy to argue, in fact, that it’s all most fans need, except it doesn’t carry in-market games, which you'll need when your team comes to your town. It also doesn’t carry non-Sunday games (obviously), nor does it have the five games this season that will be played in Europe and Mexico (which are exclusive to the NFL Network and ESPN).

Is there anything simpler?

It's much simpler to just get an antenna for local games, or a pay TV subscription. If that's not possible for you, no. The ordeal described above is really what you have to do. Although, if you're willing to watch the NFL exclusively on your phone or tablet, or move to another country, read on!

Is NFL+ the best streaming service for the NFL?

For most people, no.

Long story short: It’s one-stop shopping for live broadcasts of regular season, in-market and nationally broadcast games, which sounds amazing, except that they’re only available on your phone or tablet. For some people, this will be fine. For instance, if you’re a tollbooth operator who works afternoon and evening shifts: Run, don’t walk, to the NFL+(opens in a new tab) streaming service! You only have to pay $4.99 per month(!) to watch all the games shown by your local broadcasters, including nationally televised Sunday games.

For most people, however, NFL+ is a bit of a bust. Also worth noting: Mashable’s reviewer was not pleased with the video quality on NFL+.

How to stream the NFL in the UK

The UK's interest in NFL football has continued to grow, and they're being rewarded with three games scheduled to be played in London this October. Their other reward is a streaming method that costs much less — in terms of both money and hassle — than the U.S. equivalents: NFL Game Pass(opens in a new tab). Game Pass's Pro tier, which costs just £150.99 per year lets you watch all 270+ NFL games live — with the potential exception of the five games not played on US soil, or any other rare instance of an exclusive local TV deal for a game.

But the rare service blackouts for NFL Game Pass users are the exceptions that prove the rule — "the rule" being that Game Pass is easy to use and awesome. It shows what an NFL streaming service could be if only the NFL weren't beholden to the aforementioned highly lucrative broadcast deal. The existing deal almost certainly precludes such a user-friendly streaming experience in the U.S. But oh well.

When it comes to where people get their news, TikTok continues to increase, while other social media sites like Reddit and Facebook are on the decline.

A new survey from Pew Research Center surveyed American adults from a range of age groups about which social media sites they get their news from. TikTok and Instagram are the only platforms that have increased since 2020, while other sites included in the survey — Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, YouTube, Snapchat, LinkedIn, Twitch, and WhatsApp — have all decreased.

In the past two years, TikTok usage as a news source has gone from 22 percent to 33 percent. Instagram only went up marginally from one percentage point from 28 to 29 percent. It's worth noting, while TikTok is a growing news source, the quality of that news is questionable.

Unsurprisingly, 18 to 29-year-olds are the age group that relies on TikTok the most for staying informed. That's shot up from nine percent to 26 percent since 2020. This falls in line with earlier findings from Pew demonstrating that TikTok has become an alternative search engine for younger generations.

Facebook's decline as a news source also make sense. Rampant spread of misinformation and harmful algorithms have broken people's trust in the social media site, and Facebook is deliberately moving away from investing in its news partnerships. Ironically, Meta's new strategy is to be more like TikTok by doubling down on its short-form video feature Reels on Instagram. But that strategy is rubbing users the wrong way. Last quarter, Meta reported a loss of revenue for the first time since going public in 2007.

With Meta's quarterly earnings on the horizon, will it be another quarter or revenue loss? Or will the company's frantic pivot to stay relevant pan out? Stay tuned.

Get your wallet ready — on Oct. 26, you can slash costs on home products, computers, beauty tools, and more. Happy savings!

Best home deal

Why we like it

While it won't replace your normal vacuum, the Bissell CrossWave X7 is a powerful wet-dry vac that makes cleaning more fun — and it's much more affordable at $344.99. It works best in homes with lots of hard flooring or tile. You do have to make sure you clean and dry it every time to prevent mold and mildew buildup, but luckily, it's pretty easy to clean. It'll last you up to 30 minutes on a single charge and it clocks in at just 10 pounds, so it's a breeze to maneuver. As Mashable culture editor Brian Koerber put it, "It has a purpose and it serves that purpose well."

Best computer deal

Why we like it

Slim, portable, and good looking to boot, the Galaxy Book Flex2 has a lot to love about it. The vivid QLED display adapts to your environment to make the viewing experience easy on the eyes, even when you're outside. You can set it up in laptop mode or transform it into a portable tablet with its 2-in-1 hinge design. Plus, you can work or play around the clock with an incredibly impressive 17-hour battery life. With 16GB of RAM and 512GB storage space, you'd expect a much higher price tag on this model. But on Oct. 26, the cost is down to just $699.99 at Best Buy.

Humanity has a serious space junk problem.

On the evening of Oct. 24, NASA announced a maneuver to give the International Space Station "an extra measure of distance" from a fragment of debris (its size wasn't indicated) passing just miles away. The debris comes from Russia's dubious decision (according to top space debris experts) to blow up its around 4,850-pound Cosmos 1408 satellite in late 2021 with a missile. The explosion created a new ring of debris around Earth.

"We're going to see consequences from this particular event for the next few decades," Hugh Lewis, a professor of astronautics at the University of Southampton who researches space debris, told Mashable last year. "It wasn't a good outcome. It was never going to be a good outcome."

"There wasn't a worse target to aim for with respect for human spaceflight," Lewis added.

NASA, whose leader Bill Nelson said he was "outraged by this irresponsible and destabilizing action," is now contending with the relatively new, problematic space junk.

There are currently seven people aboard the space station, which includes three U.S. astronauts, three Russian cosmonauts, and a Japanese astronaut.

To move the ISS, the space station fired thrusters from Russia's Progress 81 spacecraft (attached to the station) for just over five minutes. NASA's flight controllers watch over and direct the station's activities at ISS Mission Control at NASA's Johnson Space Center. Russia operates its Russian Mission Control Center in Korolev, which is outside Moscow.

"The thruster firing occurred at 8:25 p.m. EDT and the maneuver had no impact on station operations. Without the maneuver, it was predicted that the fragment could have passed within about three miles from the station," the U.S. space agency said in a statement. The move was called a "Pre-Determined Debris Avoidance Maneuver."

A considerable amount of debris already zips around our planet. "There are approximately 23,000 pieces of debris larger than a softball orbiting the Earth," NASA explains. "They travel at speeds up to 17,500 mph, fast enough for a relatively small piece of orbital debris to damage a satellite or a spacecraft." The Department of Defense’s global Space Surveillance Network currently tracks much of this debris, though there are many more tiny pieces in orbit.

The mounting issue with space junk is that it can create increasingly more debris. As Mashable previously reported:

Ideally, derelict satellites and spacecraft are managed so they gradually fall into the atmosphere and burn up, in a process called atmospheric drag. NASA, and its space partners, will continue to contend with the debris created by the blown-up Cosmos 1408 satellite.

"This debris field will expand in size and spread in a ring around the Earth that will likely remain on orbit to threaten other space objects for years to come."

"This debris field will expand in size and spread in a ring around the Earth that will likely remain on orbit to threaten other space objects for years to come," the Secure World Foundation, an organization promoting sustainable and peaceful uses of space, said in a statement last year. "Regardless of rationale, to deliberately create orbital debris of this magnitude is extremely irresponsible."

Slowly but surely, Apple is turning its Dynamic Island – a pill-shaped space on top of iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max that hides the selfie camera and displays animated widgets – into a full-fledged feature.

A month ago, I wrote about a cool little gesture that the Dynamic Island supports, allowing you to turn it off with a swipe to the left or right.

With iOS 16.1, which launched Monday, the iPhones got a couple more gestures, which let you precisely adjust what you want to see or remove from the Dynamic Island.

The new gestures are swiping in or out; the first one meaning swiping from the left or right towards the middle of the Dynamic Island, and the second one meaning swiping out from the center to either side of the Dynamic Island.

Here's what you can do with these:

Swipe in when one activity is active: hide activity from the Dynamic Island

Swipe in when two activities are active: hide the activity on the side you're swiping from, which makes the other activity the "primary" activity

Swipe out when two activities are active, but one activity is hidden: unhide secondary activity

Swipe in when two activities are active, but one activity is hidden: hide primary activity

Swipe in when two activities are active, but both are hidden: unhide primary activity

Yes, this is all quite intricate, and it does take some practice to get it right, but I've tried it all out and it works.

Of course, you may wonder why you need such granular controls over the Dynamic Island, as it's mostly showing notifications and activities from a handful of Apple apps. But this is changing, too. With iOS 16.1, third-party apps can take advantage of the Dynamic Island, and some have already done so. These include meal planning app Crouton, fitness app Liftin', and flight tracking app Flighty.

Joe Biden's social media team is keeping up with the times. A tweet from the President's official account used BeReal, the app currently soaring in popularity, to encourage people to get their annual vaccines.

SEE ALSO: How to delete a BeReal post

Biden's tweet included a picture using the definitive BeReal format, though it's doubtful that the app was actually used to create said photograph. In one frame, the President is seen smiling and pointing to his shoulder. In the second image, Chief Medical Advisor Anthony Fauci and United States Surgeon General Vivek Murthy are posing together with their thumbs up.

"Got my annual, updated shot today. You should get yours too, for real. Vaccines.gov," the caption read. The BeReal reference was thrown in for good measure.

The vaccine in question is the updated Covid-19 booster vaccine, which is now being recommended for children and adults.

Biden received the vaccine on October 25, making it his third coronavirus booster shot and his fifth vaccine dose. At the White House, he said, "Can we repeat what happened in the past winters — more infections, more hospitalizations, more loved ones getting sick, even dying from the virus? Or can we have a much better winter if we use all — all — the tools we have available to us now?"

The messaging on Twitter was slightly more lighthearted, thanks to the inclusion of BeReal. Arguably, the app is at the height of social media at the moment.

The BeReal way – a daily notification, a time frame to post, and the use of both front and back camera – has captivated users and pushed other apps towards cloning, including TikTok and Instagram. The app, which now has 20 million daily users, has seen its valuation rise to just under $587 million.

POTUS was just jumping on the bandwagon, "for real".

There’s a new God of War game on the way and it’s a lot like the last God of War game .

Before I got to play through the opening four hours or so of God of War Ragnarok, I found myself lacking any pre-release excitement. That's not me being a hater, either. I'd enjoyed 2018’s PS4 reboot thanks to its retooled and surprisingly deep combat, and a scrumptious level of graphical spectacle, but every new trailer for Ragnarok seemed too familiar for my liking. It looked like yet another goofy, fun romp through Norse mythology with Kratos and his now-older son Atreus, full of the same visual splendor and excessive violence we already experienced in a title that landed on many "Game of the Year" lists four years ago.

Based on Ragnarok’s first few hours, that’s definitely the case. And shockingly, after sitting with it for a while, I think that’s...fine. Innovation and subversion are lovely — you know, like when Nintendo totally flipped the script with The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. But maybe we don’t need to demand those things from video games that often.

What I do know for certain is that when God of War Ragnarok hits PlayStation 4 and 5 on Nov. 8, you’ll feel right at home.

Haven’t seen this much snow since the “Informer” video

Ragnarok picks up a few years after the 2018 reboot, with Kratos and Atreus’ home realm of Midgard blanketed in a never-ending frost. You won’t be surprised to learn that Kratos has now angered the Norse pantheon of gods, given that he gored each and every Greek god to death in the original God of War trilogy. In fact, you won’t be surprised by much of anything in the early goings of Ragnarok.

Fans of the reboot will instantly recognize all of its mechanical and design hallmarks. Kratos and Atreus spend most of their time trudging through linear areas, hacking away at nasty freaks, and solving environmental puzzles that are usually pretty rudimentary. Just like in the last game, you do eventually get the ability to freely roam around a bit in the dwarven realm of Svartalfheim, but you’re never permitted to wander too far off the main story path. This isn't Elden Ring. You're on a pretty short leash here.

I don’t want to laud God of War Ragnarok for being unambitious, but I don’t want to hate on it for that reason, either. - Alex Perry

Even the combat is largely unchanged, though it gets fun a lot faster than the last game did. Kratos starts out with both the frosty Leviathan Axe and the scorching Blades of Chaos, and their basic movesets remain the same as before. Atreus' arrow shots are still mapped to the square button and they still serve the purpose of filling up each enemy’s stun meter, which, when full, allows Kratos to pull off a disgusting killer move.

If you liked the distinct third-person-shooter-without-guns combat in 2018's God of War, where manning both sticks and managing distance between yourself and enemies was key to success, you'll like this.

And, man, it’s still fun as hell when everything is clicking. Fights against rando enemies are fine if a little tedious at times, but boss fights still serve up all the satisfaction you could want from a game like this. An early encounter with Thor (presented here as a surly, beer-swilling grizzly bear of a man) sees Kratos and the god of thunder flying across the mountains of Midgard, and pulling off sweet tricks with the Leviathan Axe and the hammer Mjölnir. I was grinning ear-to-ear the entire time.

But that’s how the last game was, too. The big moments were big, with Kratos regularly encountering mythical creatures that were too burly to fit inside the frame of even the biggest TV you could buy. And boss fights frequently paused the action for a few seconds to play a thrilling mini-cutscene before getting right back to it. Aside from the fact that Atreus is now a teen instead of a teensy lad, little in Ragnarok has changed. And you know what? That’s cool!

Familiarity doesn’t have to breed contempt

To its credit, the game does introduce some funky new monsters early on. Credit: PlayStation

Gamers have a funny way of demanding novelty at an unsustainable clip. We want sequels to show us things we haven’t seen before. We lop the most praise onto franchise shake-ups like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Elden Ring while (in my case, at least) deriding games like Forspoken for not even trying to reinvent the wheel.

Frankly, it’s not always reasonable. Nobody expects TV or movie directors to invent a new camera between seasons or sequels. Audiences are usually happy to simply get more of what they like. It’s how Marvel has gotten away with making the same movie 25 times.

I don’t want to laud God of War Ragnarok for being unambitious, but I don’t want to hate on it for that reason, either. I’ve spent the last few months recommending the Yakuza series to anyone who will listen despite most of those games taking place on literally the same small map with only incremental changes to gameplay over time. It’d be hypocritical of me to do that and then demand that the second game in a rebooted classic PlayStation series change everything.

You have to look at the necessity of innovation on a case-by-case basis. Zelda was in a Skyward Sword-shaped rut before Breath of the Wild came out, so that reinvention was both desperately needed and deeply appreciated. Yakuza, on the other hand, maintained such a consistent level of quality through the first seven main entries that fans haven't really demanded a major reimagining. That series eventually did get one in the form of Yakuza: Like a Dragon's great turn-based combat, but we would've been fine with more of the same there, too.

Atreus has been aged up in one of the game's most significant changes from the original. Credit: PlayStation

Developer Sony Santa Monica innovated upon God of War the last time around, so the fact that Ragnarok is shaping up to be that game but more is forgivable. Especially so because, man, it’s really fun. The PS5 version is unbelievably resplendent to look at and the loop of fighting, puzzle-solving, opening chests, and slowly upgrading Kratos and Atreus with better stats and new abilities still hits all the pleasure centers in my brain.

Maybe it becomes a significantly different game later on. If so, that’s awesome. If not, hell, I’m still game to travel down this familiar road made from the bodies of slain Norse gods once again.

It's been a busy month for McDonald's news.

First we had the (fairly major) announcement that adult Happy Meals were coming to the menu (complete with grownup toys!), and now there's another addition that's sending ripples across the internet.

Yep, the McRib is apparently making a comeback — but there's a catch.

The sandwich is set to come back into wide circulation on Oct. 31, with McDonald's stressing on their site that this will be a "farewell tour".

"The McRib is back!" reads the description. "It starts with seasoned boneless pork dipped in a tangy BBQ sauce, topped with slivered onions and dill pickles, all served on a toasted homestyle bun. When everything combines you have BBQ pork sandwich perfection. Get one while you can because this is the McRib Farewell Tour."

The official press release, meanwhile, tells a slightly different story.

"Like any true farewell tour, we’re hoping this isn’t a 'goodbye' but a 'see you later,' it reads. "Because as our McRib stans have experienced time and time again: you never know when – or if – the McRib is coming back."

Given the fact the McRib has been going on farewell tours for over 15 years now, we're going to guess this isn't the last we've seen of it.

Apple will finally switch from Lightning to USB-C port on its iPhones.

The company did not officially announce anything, but its senior vice president of worldwide marketing all but confirmed it in an interview with The Wall Streeet Journal's Joanna Stern.

When asked whether Apple is moving to USB-C, Joswiak said "obviously we'll have to comply, we have no choice."

Joswiak is referring to a new set of regulations in the European Union, as well as in Brazil, which mandate the use of USB-C on smartphones. Apple has long resisted the idea, but now that the EU will actually start enforcing the law starting in 2024, the company will have to make the change if it wants to keep selling iPhones in the EU.

For users, this will simply mean most of their gadgets, whether made by Apple or some other company, will charge with the same cable.

Apple isn't too happy about this. "We think the approach would've been better environmentally, and better for our customers, for the governments to not be that prescriptive," said Joswiak.

What Joswiak wouldn't say, however, is when the switch is going to happen, exactly. "The Europeans are dictating timing for European customers," he said.

The weather just gets chillier, and the Quordles just get harder. Not really. On the whole they're no easier or harder than ever, but sometimes it seems that way.

If Quordle is a little too challenging today, you've come to the right place for hints. There aren't just hints here, but the whole Quordle solution. Scroll to the bottom of this page, and there it is. But are you sure you need all four answers? Maybe you just need a strategy guide. Either way, scroll down, and you'll get what you need.

What is Quordle?

Quordle is a five-letter word guessing game similar to Wordle, except each guess applies letters to four words at the same time. You get nine guesses instead of six to correctly guess all four words. It looks like playing four Wordle games at the same time, and that is essentially what it is. But it's not nearly as intimidating as it sounds.

Is Quordle harder than Wordle?

Yes, though not diabolically so.

Where did Quordle come from?

Amid the Wordle boom of late 2021 and early 2022, when everyone was learning to love free, in-browser, once-a-day word guessing games, creator Freddie Meyer says he took inspiration from one of the first big Wordle variations, Dordle — the one where you essentially play two Wordles at once. He took things up a notch, and released Quordle on January 30. Meyer's creation was covered in The Guardian six days later, and now, according to Meyer, it attracts millions of daily users. Today, Meyer earns modest revenue from Patreon, where dedicated Quordle fans can donate to keep their favorite puzzle game running.

How is Quordle pronounced?

“Kwordle.” It should rhyme with “Wordle,” and definitely should not be pronounced exactly like "curdle.”

Is Quordle strategy different from Wordle?

Yes and no.

Your starting strategy should be the same as with Wordle. In fact, if you have a favorite Wordle opening word, there’s no reason to change that here. We suggest something rich in vowels, featuring common letters like C, R, and N. But you do you.

After your first guess, however, you’ll notice things getting out of control if you play Quordle exactly like Wordle.

What should I do in Quordle that I don’t do in Wordle?

Solving a Wordle puzzle can famously come down to a series of single letter-change variations. If you’ve narrowed it down to “-IGHT,” you could guess “MIGHT” “NIGHT” “LIGHT” and “SIGHT” and one of those will probably be the solution — though this is also a famous way to end up losing in Wordle, particularly if you play on “hard mode.” In Quordle, however, this sort of single-letter winnowing is a deadly trap, and it hints at the important strategic difference between Wordle and Quordle: In Quordle, you can't afford to waste guesses unless you're eliminating as many letters as possible at all times.

Guessing a completely random word that you already know isn't the solution, just to eliminate three or four possible letters you haven’t tried yet, is thought of as a desperate, latch-ditch move in Wordle. In Quordle, however, it's a normal part of the player's strategic toolset.

Is there a way to get the answer faster?

In my experience Quordle can be a slow game, sometimes dragging out longer than it would take to play Wordle four times. But a sort of blunt-force guessing approach can speed things up. The following strategy also works with Wordle if you only want the solution, and don’t care about having the fewest possible guesses:

Try starting with a series of words that puts all the vowels (including Y) on the board, along with some other common letters. We've had good luck with the three words: “NOTES,” “ACRID,” and “LUMPY.” YouTuber DougMansLand suggests four words: “CANOE,” “SKIRT,” “PLUMB,” and “FUDGY.”

Most of the alphabet is now eliminated, and you’ll only have the ability to make one or two wrong guesses if you use this strategy. But in most cases you’ll have all the information you need to guess the remaining words without any wrong guesses.

If strategy isn't helping, and you're still stumped, here are some hints:

Are there any double or triple letters in today’s Quordle words?

No.

Are any rare letters being used in today’s Quordle like Q or Z?

No.

What do today’s Quordle words start with?

R, B, T, and C.

What are the answers for today’s Quordle?

Are you sure you want to know?

There’s still time to turn back.

OK, you asked for it. The answers are:
The weather just gets chillier, and the Quordles just get harder. Not really. On the whole they're no easier or harder than ever, but sometimes it seems that way.

If Quordle is a little too challenging today, you've come to the right place for hints. There aren't just hints here, but the whole Quordle solution. Scroll to the bottom of this page, and there it is. But are you sure you need all four answers? Maybe you just need a strategy guide. Either way, scroll down, and you'll get what you need.

What is Quordle?

Quordle is a five-letter word guessing game similar to Wordle, except each guess applies letters to four words at the same time. You get nine guesses instead of six to correctly guess all four words. It looks like playing four Wordle games at the same time, and that is essentially what it is. But it's not nearly as intimidating as it sounds.

Is Quordle harder than Wordle?

Yes, though not diabolically so.

Where did Quordle come from?

Amid the Wordle boom of late 2021 and early 2022, when everyone was learning to love free, in-browser, once-a-day word guessing games, creator Freddie Meyer says he took inspiration from one of the first big Wordle variations, Dordle — the one where you essentially play two Wordles at once. He took things up a notch, and released Quordle on January 30. Meyer's creation was covered in The Guardian six days later, and now, according to Meyer, it attracts millions of daily users. Today, Meyer earns modest revenue from Patreon, where dedicated Quordle fans can donate to keep their favorite puzzle game running.

How is Quordle pronounced?

“Kwordle.” It should rhyme with “Wordle,” and definitely should not be pronounced exactly like "curdle.”

Is Quordle strategy different from Wordle?

Yes and no.

Your starting strategy should be the same as with Wordle. In fact, if you have a favorite Wordle opening word, there’s no reason to change that here. We suggest something rich in vowels, featuring common letters like C, R, and N. But you do you.

After your first guess, however, you’ll notice things getting out of control if you play Quordle exactly like Wordle.

What should I do in Quordle that I don’t do in Wordle?

Solving a Wordle puzzle can famously come down to a series of single letter-change variations. If you’ve narrowed it down to “-IGHT,” you could guess “MIGHT” “NIGHT” “LIGHT” and “SIGHT” and one of those will probably be the solution — though this is also a famous way to end up losing in Wordle, particularly if you play on “hard mode.” In Quordle, however, this sort of single-letter winnowing is a deadly trap, and it hints at the important strategic difference between Wordle and Quordle: In Quordle, you can't afford to waste guesses unless you're eliminating as many letters as possible at all times.

It is Wednesday, my dudes, and it's time for Wordle! Technically, you have all day, but there's nothing more stressful than remembering you haven't played at 11:50pm and having just a few minutes to save your streak. No matter which side of midnight you favor for diving into your favorite word puzzle, we've got some clues and the solution to help you out, as we do every day.

If you just want today's word, you can jump straight to the end of this article for October 26's Wordle solution, for puzzle #494. If you'd rather work through it yourself, keep reading for some tips, tricks, and clues.

Where did Wordle come from?

Wordle was initially created by engineer Josh Wardle as a gift for his partner, though it quickly spread until it became an international phenomenon. Thousands of players across the globe tackle Wordle each day, with some fans even having created alternate versions of the daily word puzzle game. These include battle royale format Squabble, music identification game Heardle, and variations like Dordle and Quordle that make you guess multiple words at once.

The popularity of Wordle even reached such heights that the New York Times bought it earlier this year, while TikTok creators live-stream themselves playing it.

What's the best Wordle starting word?

The goal of Wordle is to have fun, and there's no right way to have fun. Just choose whatever starting word feels right to you, and don't let anyone shame you for it. However, if you want to take a more strategic approach, we have a few ideas to help you pick a word that will spark joy. One tip is to select a word that includes at least two different vowels, plus some common consonants like S, T, R, or N.

What happened to the Wordle archive?

The entire archive of past Wordles used to be available for anyone to play in glorious days gone by. Unfortunately it has since been taken down, with the website's creator stating it was done at the request of the New York Times.

Is Wordle getting harder?

If you're finding Wordle too easy, you can try enabling its Hard Mode to give your brain a tougher challenge. But Wordle isn't getting any harder by itself — it's the same difficulty that it's always been.

Why are there two different Wordle answers some days?

Wordle is a fun, collective experience specifically because everyone's solving for the same word every day. Occasionally, though, Wordle has accepted two different solutions as correct on the same day. This is because the New York Times made changes to the Wordle word list after acquiring it, and sometimes swaps out words from the original list. To ensure you're getting the right answer every day, refresh your browser before you play — the site will save your streak.

Here's a subtle hint for today's Wordle answer:

It's a verb, and you usually do it to rules.

Does today's Wordle answer have a double letter?

Nope!

Today's Wordle is a 5-letter word that starts with...

The letter... F. (Yup, the same as yesterday!)

What's the answer to Wordle today?

In House of the Dragon, fashion is a powerful thing. Look no further than Alicent Hightower all but declaring civil war with one green dress, which led to the court splitting into camps of the Greens (those who support Alicent) and the Blacks (those who support Rhaenyra).

But what about the smaller accessories? The masks, crowns, and more of House of the Dragon speak just as loudly as the colors characters wear. When presented with an admirable collection of shiny new fantasy accessories, there's only one thing to do: rank them from worst to best.

I've chosen 15 of the most prominent accessories featured in Season 1 of House of the Dragon in order to crown one overall winner. All of these pieces are deeply associated with a character, important to the plot, or just have ridiculously awesome vibes. Full disclosure: In my ranking system, vibes tend to win out over everything. You have been warned, just in case your favorite accessory didn't make the cut. Here, from worst to best, are the House of the Dragon accessories, ranked.

Dishonorable mention: Criston Cole's disguise hat

Criston needs to step up his hat game. Credit: Ollie Upton / HBO

This hat is by no means a staple of Ser Criston Cole's wardrobe, but boy did it give me a major chuckle when it appeared in episode 9. One, it's not a particularly nice hat, and two, it's an awful disguise! Did Criston just grab whichever hat screamed "peasant," throw it on his head, and think, "Yeah, that should do it"? Sorry to break it to you, Criston, but even a hat won't disguise your very punchable face.

15. Otto Hightower's hand pin

You've got to hand it to him... Credit: Ollie Upton / HBO

The pin worn by the Hand of the King comes with a lot of historical weight, making it one of the most important accessories in the show. However, we've seen it before in Game of Thrones, so it's nothing super new. Dropping it to the bottom of the list is the fact that notorious schemer Otto Hightower wears the pin for most of the show. You will never be Ned Stark, Otto! Although you're savvy and dishonorable enough to outlive him, I'll give you that.

14. Alicent Hightower's necklaces

The Queen of the Seven Kingdoms (and of the color green). Credit: Ollie Upton / HBO

While I can't count "the color green" (which we all know Alicent owns) as an accessory, I can count the seven-pointed star necklaces she wears once she becomes queen. They aren't always noticeable, but they serve as reminders of her faith to the Seven. Unfortunately, the seven-pointed stars, paired with the Hightowers' redecoration of the Red Keep with religious paraphernalia, give off more of a religious fundamentalist vibe than anything else. I may not love Alicent's jewelry, but her dresses? Great gowns, beautiful gowns.

13. Daemon Targaryen's crown

Driftwood, so hot right now. Credit: Ollie Upton

When Daemon makes his grand return to King's Landing after killing the Crabfeeder, he comes wearing a very peculiar crown. No gold or iron for the King of the Narrow Sea: This is a crown made of driftwood. Sustainable! Daemon doesn't wear it for long, as he gives it to Viserys in a show of loyalty, but in the little time we get with it, it makes quite a striking impression. Still, I have questions. Did Daemon get someone to make this for him? Or, even better, did he partake in a little arts and crafts session on the dragon ride back from the Stepstones?

12. Aemma Arryn's ring

A queen who deserved better. Credit: Ollie Upton / HBO

We don't see much of Aemma Arryn's ring — a simple gold ring with an Arryn falcon design — but the few times we do, it packs a tearful punch. Viserys kisses it after Aemma dies during a traumatic and fatal C-section (which he ordered, to be clear). Later, in episode 6, we see him holding it and kissing it again after he learns of Rhaenyra's departure to Dragonstone, remembering her mother and the horrible way she died. Throughout that episode, you can also see Rhaenyra wearing a small gold ring that I'm pretty sure is Aemma's. If so, that means that when she left for Dragonstone, she gave it to her father as a memento. Such a small thing, to carry such deep emotional meaning.

11. Aegon II Targaryen's crown

Put that crown back where it came from or so help me. Credit: Ollie Upton / HBO

When Aegon II is crowned King of Westeros, he doesn't don the gold crown of his father Viserys. Instead, he wears the iron crown of his namesake, Aegon the Conqueror. To its credit, the crown itself strikes a nice balance between royal and intimidating. But the fact that the crown was placed on a usurper's head during a coup docks it many, many places. Aegon II can't hold a candle to Aegon I, and he most definitely doesn't deserve his crown.

10. Rhaenys Targaryen's Bump-It

That's why her hair is so big, it's full of Bump-Its. Credit: Ollie Upton / HBO

Remember Bump-Its, the inserts you put under your hair to give it unnatural volume? Well, Rhaenys is wearing whatever the Westerosi equivalent of that is, because her hair is lifted off her head. It makes for an extra striking hairdo, one that evokes the crown she never wore as the Queen Who Never Was. Also, as with Daemon's Driftwood Craft Session, I just love the image of Rhaenys clipping some kind of Bump-It into her hair. Whatever she's doing, it's working.

9. Larys Strong's cane

"Murder my family? Who, me?" Credit: Ollie Upton / HBO

Kinslaying creep Larys Strong uses his cane as both a mobility aid and an opportunity for personal branding. The cane's pommel is adorned with a firefly. That's not the sigil of House Strong — it's his own personal sigil. Larys may be the snakiest of snakes, but I appreciate his commitment to branching out from his family and creating a sinister public image for himself. You know what I don't appreciate? Him killing his family and degrading Alicent. Bad Larys. (Cool cane, though.)

8. Viserys and Rhaenyra Targaryen's crown

A crown fit for a queen Credit: Olli Upton / HBO

The third and final crown on this list is the one worn by Viserys and later gifted to Rhaenyra by Ser Erryk Cargyll. Originally worn by King Jaehaerys, this crown easily takes the top "crown" spot on the list. Not only do we spend the most time with it on screen, but we also see it get passed down to Rhaenyra in the season finale. Watching the rightful Queen of Westeros take up her father's crown is the result of 10 episodes of buildup, and the moment is cathartic despite the warlike circumstances. Erryk also deserves major praise for pulling off what must have been quite the heist.

7. Daemon Targaryen's murder cloak

Dressed. To. Kill. Credit: Ollie Upton / HBO

Daemon knows how to accessorize for any occasion, but he pays extra attention when he's plotting something nefarious. Whether he's dispatching his first wife Rhea Royce or organizing the "death" of Laenor Velaryon, you can bet he's wearing his trusty murder cloak. The cloak's dramatic flair is often imitated — looking at you, Aemond — but never replicated.

6. Viserys Targaryen's Valyrian steel dagger

This scene! This dagger! All great. Credit: Ollie Upton / HBO

Turns out the Valyrian steel dagger that Arya Stark used to kill the Night King in Game of Thrones has quite the illustrious Targaryen history. As Viserys shows Rhaenyra in House of the Dragon's first episode, text on the dagger outlines Aegon the Conqueror's prophetic dream, which he calls "the Song of Ice and Fire." The dagger is also the center of one of the season's tensest scenes: Alicent's attempt to take out Lucerys's eye in retribution for Aemond's. A cool-looking dagger that proves crucial to the plot? That's a great accessory, right there.

5. Daemon Targaryen's sword, Dark Sister

That's a sword with a lot of history. Credit: Ollie Upton / HBO

Joining the Valyrian steel dagger in the "cool weapons club" is Daemon's sword, named Dark Sister. House of the Dragon doesn't delve into the blade's history that much, but it is one of two ancestral Targaryen swords. Aegon the Conqueror's sister (and wife) Visenya wielded it in the conquest of Westeros. Now, Daemon uses it to take down the Crabfeeder and slice the heads off of anyone who speaks out against Rhaenyra — clearly, it's still sharp.

4. Rhaenyra Targaryen's necklace

Just a wholesome uncle-niece gift Credit: Ollie Upton / HBO

In episode 1, Daemon gifts Rhaenyra with a Valyrian steel necklace, so that she can carry a piece of their ancestral land with her. Rhaenyra takes to wearing the necklace everywhere, highlighting her connection to — and later love of — Daemon. I don't love the incest, but I do love the foreshadowing power of jewelry.

3. The Crabfeeder's mask

The Crabfeeder understands you have to look good while terrorizing the Stepstones. Credit: Ollie Upton / HBO

Craghas Drahar, aka the Crabfeeder, was House of the Dragon's first major villain, and he set the bar high. Sure, we didn't know much about him, but we did know about his gnarly habit of leaving vanquished soldiers out on the beach for the crabs to eat, and honestly, that's good enough for me. Adding to his mystique was his gold horned mask, which you might recognize as a Sons of the Harpy mask from Game of Thrones. It may have hidden his true identity, but it crafted a villainous persona for the ages.

2. Viserys Targaryen's gold mask

Is your face rotting? Have you tried... a gold mask? Credit: Ollie Upton / HBO

Viserys takes a page from the Crabfeeder's book in episode 8 of House of the Dragon, when he shows up to court wearing a gold half-mask. As we see later in the episode, the mask is covering the rotting side of his face and his empty eye socket — a truly beautiful solution for a very gnarly problem. Even Viserys actor Paddy Considine acknowledged the true dramatic power of the mask: in a behind-the-scenes video, he struts around the Throne Room in his mask, twirling his cane and proclaiming he's "serving Targaryen realness." He is, and it looks awesome.

1. Aemond Targaryen's sapphire and eye patch combo

Elite accessorizing by Ameond Credit: Ollie Upton / HBO

The absolute best and coolest accessory in House of the Dragon is a two for one. Aemond Targaryen loses his eye as a boy and decides, "You know what? I'm going to take this as an opportunity for maximum drama." He stalks around King's Landing in an elegant leather eye patch, striking fear into the hearts of all who look at him.

But wait, there's more! As the finale reveals, there's an extra-special something under that eye patch: an icy blue sapphire. That's right, Aemond has casually been hiding a precious stone in his eye socket for entire episodes, just waiting for the perfect moment to reveal it. The man understands dramatic timing, and the payoff is glorious. Take a bow, Aemond. That is how you accessorize. Here's hoping you can kick off a new Westerosi fashion trend where everyone dresses like spooky bejeweled pirates.
In House of the Dragon, fashion is a powerful thing. Look no further than Alicent Hightower all but declaring civil war with one green dress, which led to the court splitting into camps of the Greens (those who support Alicent) and the Blacks (those who support Rhaenyra).

In episode 1, Daemon gifts Rhaenyra with a Valyrian steel necklace, so that she can carry a piece of their ancestral land with her. Rhaenyra takes to wearing the necklace everywhere, highlighting her connection to — and later love of — Daemon. I don't love the incest, but I do love the foreshadowing power of jewelry.

Craghas Drahar, aka the Crabfeeder, was House of the Dragon's first major villain, and he set the bar high. Sure, we didn't know much about him, but we did know about his gnarly habit of leaving vanquished soldiers out on the beach for the crabs to eat, and honestly, that's good enough for me. Adding to his mystique was his gold horned mask, which you might recognize as a Sons of the Harpy mask from Game of Thrones. It may have hidden his true identity, but it crafted a villainous persona for the ages.

Viserys takes a page from the Crabfeeder's book in episode 8 of House of the Dragon, when he shows up to court wearing a gold half-mask. As we see later in the episode, the mask is covering the rotting side of his face and his empty eye socket — a truly beautiful solution for a very gnarly problem. Even Viserys actor Paddy Considine acknowledged the true dramatic power of the mask: in a behind-the-scenes video, he struts around the Throne Room in his mask, twirling his cane and proclaiming he's "serving Targaryen realness." He is, and it looks awesome.

The absolute best and coolest accessory in House of the Dragon is a two for one. Aemond Targaryen loses his eye as a boy and decides, "You know what? I'm going to take this as an opportunity for maximum drama." He stalks around King's Landing in an elegant leather eye patch, striking fear into the hearts of all who look at him.

But wait, there's more! As the finale reveals, there's an extra-special something under that eye patch: an icy blue sapphire. That's right, Aemond has casually been hiding a precious stone in his eye socket for entire episodes, just waiting for the perfect moment to reveal it. The man understands dramatic timing, and the payoff is glorious. Take a bow, Aemond. That is how you accessorize. Here's hoping you can kick off a new Westerosi fashion trend where everyone dresses like spooky bejeweled pirates.
YouTube is high on the success of YouTube Shorts, a short-form video offering they introduced in September 2020 to compete with TikTok. In June, Shorts had more than 1.5 billion monthly users. And last month, YouTube announced new monetization opportunities for the format, a move that indicated that it was becoming big business for YouTube and a viable revenue source for creators.

However, reports of users being shown transphobic Shorts are spreading across other social media platforms. YouTube users say transphobic videos are appearing on their feeds among seemingly unrelated content. The largest call out has come from one of the platform's oldest, most-respected, and prolific creators, Hank Green:

Shorts is the default tab in the YouTube app, which means it's the first thing you see when you open it. Users have been noting how being confronted with that kind of content makes them feel:

YouTube has historically struggled to moderate hate and misinformation. Recently Jessie Earl, a trans YouTube creator, has been vocal about YouTube flagging a video critiquing anti-trans comments from YouTuber Matt Walsh. Earl argues that Walsh’s videos promote anti-trans rhetoric and have not received similar treatment.

But some users are shocked by just how prevalent transphobic content is on Shorts, and how hard it is to get rid of it. One Redditor claims, "A solid half of the videos recommended to me are intensely transphobic. I hit 'don’t recommend me this channel,' but it doesn’t seem to work."

Like TikTok, the Shorts recommendation algorithm feeds content to the user in an endless scroll. A user might not click on a transphobic long-form YouTube video, but they aren't given that same choice when spoon-fed a 15-second video in the Shorts tab.

Doctor Who's new Doctor, Ncuti Gatwa, couldn't be happier to take a spin in the TARDIS.

In a discussion with President of Disney Branded Television Ayo Davis at a Disney+ event, Gatwa shared his thoughts on taking up the mantle of the legendary character.

"I feel amazing," he said. "I get silenced...my mouth is paralyzed every time I think about the concept of playing this role because of what it means to the fans, to everyone that watches."

Gatwa will play the Fifteenth Doctor, following on the heels of David Tennant. Tennant played the Tenth Doctor from 2005 to 2010 and will be returning as the Fourteenth Doctor for three special episodes next year. Gatwa is best known for stealing scenes as the incredible Eric Effiong in Sex Education.

While talking with Davis, Gatwa also addressed the show's importance to British culture, and what it means to have a person of color and an immigrant in the role. "As a show...its roots are so deep within British culture and the fabric of Britishness that as a Rwandan immigrant to the country, it feels really powerful," Gatwa said.

Gatwa also highlighted the show's importance "for people of color, for marginalized people that really gravitate towards the show, because it's about friendship, and it's about adventure, and it's about union and unity."

"And also, the Doctor can regenerate into anything," Gatwa continued. "The possibilities are endless, and the fact that that notion is going out to lots of people...I think it's just really beautiful."

On the topic of what we can expect from his outing as the Doctor, Gatwa remained coy. "I don't want to get fired, I just got the job," he laughed.

However, he did confirm that he has seen the inside of his TARDIS. We can all assume it's bigger on the inside.

Twitter staff proved to be unwavering in a response to the latest tough talk from the company's perhaps soon-to-be-owner Elon Musk.

The Tesla and Space X chief told potential investors that he'd fire about 75 percent of current Twitter employees should his takeover of the tech company go through, the Washington Post reported last week. Time Magazine reported Tuesday that staff at Twitter have penned an open letter protesting that idea, calling it a "reckless" threat that would "hurt Twitter’s ability to serve the public conversation."

Time's Billy Perrigo reported that the letter is circulating among staff, laying out demands for respect, safety, protection, and dignity if the Musk deal closes.

"We demand transparent, prompt and thoughtful communication around our working conditions," the letter read. "We demand to be treated with dignity, and to not be treated as mere pawns in a game played by billionaires."

The letter, according to Time, said the employees would not be intimated and that threatening workers' jobs threatened the platforms ability to "uplift independent journalism in Ukraine and Iran, as well as powering social movements around the world." The letter read, in part:

A threat to workers at Twitter is a threat to Twitter’s future. These threats have an impact on us as workers and demonstrate a fundamental disconnect with the realities of operating Twitter. They threaten our livelihoods, access to essential healthcare, and the ability for visa holders to stay in the country they work in. We cannot do our work in an environment of constant harassment and threats.

Just because Musk claimed he would fire 75 percent of staff, however, doesn't mean he necessarily would be willing or able to do so. The billionaire does have a penchant for exaggeration and making bold, baseless claims. Mashable's Chris Taylor wrote about how Musk "probably won't fire 75 percent of Twitter," noting that it could be a move to please investors and that he's actually said in the past that he'd increase the company's headcount. In short, Musk says a lot, but that doesn't necessarily mean it will happen.

It remains to be seen if the Musk deal for Twitter actually, finally goes through this time, though it now seems much more likely than it had in the past. The funding for the $44 billion purchase price is still coming together but lots of potential hurdles have already been cleared.

If the deal does go through, we should know by end of the week. From there, who knows what happens.

Meditation app Calm is delving into a beloved realm of storytelling, launching a multi-year collaboration with the Roald Dahl Story Company, the company dedicated to protecting and uplifting the works of the author.

The collaboration will see the creation of Sleep Stories (Calm's signature library of bedtime stories) and soundscapes related to the Dahl universe. A mix of bespoke stories and existing extracts from his many works will be offered to members of the app.

Actor Henry Golding, of Crazy Rich Asians fame, is kicking off the partnership with a Sleep Story inspired by Charlie and the Chocolate Factory: the spin-off is titled "Charlie and the Dream Factory".

Golding says he "grew up reading Roald Dahl".

"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory has forever been one of my favourite children’s stories. So what a treat to be able to narrate 'Charlie and the Dream Factory' for Calm," the actor says in a statement from the app. "There is nothing quite like drifting into a deep sleep as the imagination blossoms."

Calm already has a wealth of dreamy, celebrity-voiced content to offer its users, with offerings from the likes of Regé-Jean Page, Jonathan Bailey, and Harry Styles, to name a few.

Following Golding's voyage into the Chocolate Factory, the next title to be explored is Matilda, from which Kirby Howell-Baptiste will narrate an extract. Future Calm x Roald Dahl content will include classics such as The Big Friendly Giant and The Witches.

For lovers of nostalgia, YA books, or just a good Sleep Story, this seems like a fruitful alliance indeed.

Apple's new, 10th generation iPad will be available for purchase on Wednesday, Oct. 26. It's very different from the entry-level iPad of yesteryear, with a new design that resembles the iPad Air and the iPad Pro.

But the starting price is also higher at $449, up from $329 which is the price for the old, 9th generation iPad that Apple still sells. So is the new iPad a good purchase? We've got some thoughts on that.

Price

Yes, the price is higher than before. It's harder to justify spending $449 for an entry-level device. But what you're really measuring the new iPad against is the iPad Air, which launched in March, and starts at $599.

Here's why: The new iPad is a dead ringer for the iPad Air. The two devices have essentially the same design, with even bezels on all sides. Both have a 10.9-inch display, roughly the same cameras, and come with either 64GB or 256GB of storage memory.

I was able to compare the two side by side, though, and they are basically twins when it comes to look and feel. The new iPad doesn't feel cheaper in any way; in fact, if you get it in one of the bright new colors, it looks...well, new.

For our detailed comparison between the two devices, go here. There are differences between the iPad and the iPad Air; the Air has a better display and a far more powerful chip, among other differences.

But if you want a modern-looking iPad that's powerful enough to do iPad things, you can now get one for $449, and the $150 you save can go towards a keyboard or a case. For many users, it'll be the right choice.

Colors

Real pink. Credit: Stan Schroeder/Mashable

The new iPad comes in four colors: Silver, Blue, Pink, and Yellow, but these colors are different from your typical Apple gadget colors. The Pink and Yellow are particularly vibrant, and you can also get matching covers for each color. Let's put it this way: These are the least boring iPad colors ever.

Apple sent me a pink iPad to check out, and I can attest that it is, indeed, quite pink. The yellow variant I haven't seen in person, but it appears to be equally cheerful. This is something to think about given that the five colors on offer for the iPad Air are very subdued.

Magic Keyboard

Curiously, even though Apple updated both the iPad and the iPad Pro in October, only the iPad got a new, matching accessory: The new, Magic Keyboard Folio.

This keyboard is a lot better than the one you get for the iPad Pro. Credit: Stan Schroeder/Mashable

Yes, it costs $249, and yes, that's too much. But it's the best iPad keyboard Apple ever launched, with an additional row of function keys on top and, mercifully, an escape button in the top left. It also folds differently to the Magic Keyboard for iPad Pro (which, in its 11-inch variant, doubles as the keyboard for the iPad Air, but is not compatible with the iPad), and in my opinion it's a slightly better design as the keyboard is easier to open.

We're not saying the Magic Keyboard is a must-buy; in fact, it's probably overkill for the entry-level iPad. But if you do plan to buy one, know that the version for the iPad is currently the best one you can buy.

Front-facing camera in the right place

It's hard to make it out, but the front-facing camera is where it should be: up top and center when the device is in landscape mode. Credit: Stan Schroeder/Mashable

For some reason, Apple's iPad Pro and iPad Air models still have the front-facing camera up top when you hold the device in portrait mode. The new iPad has the camera in the right place: On the side, so it's up top when the device is in landscape mode. Since you'll probably be doing most of your video calls with the iPad on a desk in front of you, this is the preferable place for the selfie camera.

Cheaper accessories

Yes, the Magic Keyboard for the iPad is too pricy at $249. But that's certainly better than the $299 you'll have to dish out for the Magic Keyboard for the 11-inch iPad Pro and the iPad Air.

The new iPad is only compatible with the 1st generation Apple Pencil, which isn't great, given that you'll need a dongle (mercifully included with the Pencil) to charge it. But that Pencil is also cheaper at $99 versus the $129 which is the price for the 2nd generation Pencil. It's not much, but if you intend to fully deck out your iPad with accessories, it adds up.

Now that we've listed the reasons why you should buy the new iPad, here are a couple of reasons why you might consider skipping it.

Apple Pencil confusion

This....is not ideal. Credit: Stan Schroeder/Mashable

We mentioned it up there, but it's worth repeating: The new iPad is only compatible with the first generation Apple Pencil, which charges via a Lightning connector, and the new iPad has a USB-C connector. Yes, Apple now includes a dongle with the first generation Apple Pencil, but if you hate dongles (I do), and if you really plan to use Apple Pencil a lot, this could be a dealbreaker for you.

Apple sent me both versions of the Pencil and the dongle, and sure, the old Pencil combined with the dongle charged on the iPad just fine. But it's just so messy and un-Apple like, I'd rather avoid it if in any way possible.

No anti-reflective coating

The display on the new iPad may appear the same as the one on the iPad Air, but it's not. For one, it's not fully laminated, which makes the device slightly thicker.

The display is not bad, but it has a couple of drawbacks. Credit: Stan Schroeder/Mashable

While that wasn't a big deal for me, there's another small detail that does matter: anti-reflective coating. The thing is, the new iPad's display doesn't have it, whereas the iPad Air does. And when I positioned the two devices next to each other, in a fairly dark room, the difference was pretty noticeable. In the sunlight, the difference is even bigger. It's one of those details that you don't notice until you try an improved version, and going back is hard. It's not a dealbreaker by any means, but if you plan to use the iPad outdoors a lot, it's something to consider.

Price

Wait, what? Didn't we just say that the price was a positive?

Well, the price of the new iPad is $449, which is alright when compared to the $599 iPad Air. But it's the most expensive the entry-level iPad has ever been. It's a massive, 35 percent hike compared to last year's model. And that model, the 9th generation iPad, is still available in the Apple Store for $329. Given that it's an old model, you might even be able to get it for cheaper elsewhere.

Sure, the old iPad has the same old design and only comes in Silver and Space Gray colors, but if you really just need an iPad that performs the simple, tablet tasks and you want it for the least amount of money possible, maybe you should skip the fancy new one and save $120 in the process.

We're not saying the Magic Keyboard is a must-buy; in fact, it's probably overkill for the entry-level iPad. But if you do plan to buy one, know that the version for the iPad is currently the best one you can buy.

Front-facing camera in the right place

It's hard to make it out, but the front-facing camera is where it should be: up top and center when the device is in landscape mode. Credit: Stan Schroeder/Mashable

For some reason, Apple's iPad Pro and iPad Air models still have the front-facing camera up top when you hold the device in portrait mode. The new iPad has the camera in the right place: On the side, so it's up top when the device is in landscape mode. Since you'll probably be doing most of your video calls with the iPad on a desk in front of you, this is the preferable place for the selfie camera.

Cheaper accessories

Yes, the Magic Keyboard for the iPad is too pricy at $249. But that's certainly better than the $299 you'll have to dish out for the Magic Keyboard for the 11-inch iPad Pro and the iPad Air.

The new iPad is only compatible with the 1st generation Apple Pencil, which isn't great, given that you'll need a dongle (mercifully included with the Pencil) to charge it. But that Pencil is also cheaper at $99 versus the $129 which is the price for the 2nd generation Pencil. It's not much, but if you intend to fully deck out your iPad with accessories, it adds up.

Now that we've listed the reasons why you should buy the new iPad, here are a couple of reasons why you might consider skipping it.

Apple Pencil confusion

This....is not ideal. Credit: Stan Schroeder/Mashable

We mentioned it up there, but it's worth repeating: The new iPad is only compatible with the first generation Apple Pencil, which charges via a Lightning connector, and the new iPad has a USB-C connector. Yes, Apple now includes a dongle with the first generation Apple Pencil, but if you hate dongles (I do), and if you really plan to use Apple Pencil a lot, this could be a dealbreaker for you.

Apple sent me both versions of the Pencil and the dongle, and sure, the old Pencil combined with the dongle charged on the iPad just fine. But it's just so messy and un-Apple like, I'd rather avoid it if in any way possible.

No anti-reflective coating

The display on the new iPad may appear the same as the one on the iPad Air, but it's not. For one, it's not fully laminated, which makes the device slightly thicker.

The display is not bad, but it has a couple of drawbacks. Credit: Stan Schroeder/Mashable

While that wasn't a big deal for me, there's another small detail that does matter: anti-reflective coating. The thing is, the new iPad's display doesn't have it, whereas the iPad Air does. And when I positioned the two devices next to each other, in a fairly dark room, the difference was pretty noticeable. In the sunlight, the difference is even bigger. It's one of those details that you don't notice until you try an improved version, and going back is hard. It's not a dealbreaker by any means, but if you plan to use the iPad outdoors a lot, it's something to consider.

Price

Wait, what? Didn't we just say that the price was a positive?

Well, the price of the new iPad is $449, which is alright when compared to the $599 iPad Air. But it's the most expensive the entry-level iPad has ever been. It's a massive, 35 percent hike compared to last year's model. And that model, the 9th generation iPad, is still available in the Apple Store for $329. Given that it's an old model, you might even be able to get it for cheaper elsewhere.

Sure, the old iPad has the same old design and only comes in Silver and Space Gray colors, but if you really just need an iPad that performs the simple, tablet tasks and you want it for the least amount of money possible, maybe you should skip the fancy new one and save $120 in the process.
We're in the midst of a high-stakes time in dating. It's cuffing season, when people scour dating apps to find a partner for the colder months (at least in the northern hemisphere). This year we also have to contend with winter coating, a trend of people reaching out to exes in the hopes of putting on an old "coat" (getting back together) for the holidays.

That's not the only trend going on. On the opposite side of winter coating is cobwebbing, which comes from the dating app Bumble.

SEE ALSO: Zodiac signs are coming to Hinge profiles

Cobwebbing is dusting off the "cobwebs" — or old flames — so you can start fresh with someone new. As explained by Bumble's sex and relationship expert Dr. Caroline West, "By actively 'cobwebbing' your environment of the past, you can then move forward feeling more empowered, confident and open to meeting someone new."

West, a Ph.D. in sexuality studies, added, "Holding on to past relationships, whether that be phone numbers, messages, or even an old t-shirt, can hold you back when it comes to dating as you're not mentally focussed on the present."

As difficult as it may be to release your exes, it may be just what you need in order to move on. In addition to cuffing season, it's also spooky season — and it's time for those old ghosts to leave.

Scorpio szn in the middle of cuffing season? Buckle up, daters.

Astrology is at the crux of our Instagram feeds and TikTok FYPs. Love, tolerate, or despise them, zodiac signs have infiltrated daily life – and the dating scene.

Hinge has added a new feature catering to this obsession, allowing users to add their sun signs to their profiles.

The Match Group-owned app is joining the likes of Bumble, which introduced zodiac signs to profiles in late 2018, much to the excitement of certain users. The app even allowed daters to filter potential matches by astrology, so those constantly looking to avoid certain signs got their wish.

You can also add your pets to your profile vitals. Credit: Hinge.

The app took the plunge into astrology-based dating based on user research. The dating app found that astrology is "immensely popular" amongst single people, especially LGBTQ users. Hinge found LGBTQ users are 86 percent more likely than heterosexual users to add their zodiac signs to their profiles.

Alongside the addition of the cosmic feature, Hinge is also letting daters add pets to their profile vitals. Users can indicate which pets they have, if any. In the words of the app, "Let people know you're a package deal." In research carried out by the app, Hinge found that 59 percent of users enjoyed talking about their pets with new dates, while 60 percent said the addition of pets to their dating profiles helped them express who they are.

Both new additions offered by Hinge comes after a flurry of profile additions from the app. Hinge recently added polls and video prompts, diversifying profiles and aiming to spark conversation.

Our biggest takeaway? Your sun sign may be the reason someone bothers to reply to one of your Hinge prompts. Or their justification for not letting the conversation go anywhere at all.

Swiping on your uni crush just got a lot easier.

Dating app Tinder is launching Tinder Uni in the UK to enable university students to match with fellow students on campus — as well people studying further afield at nearby unis.

Tinder Uni can only be accessed by students with a uni email address (ending in ac.uk) and users will have to confirm that email address in order to gain access to the feature. This means you won't see profiles from non-students while scrolling on the dating app's feature.

How does Tinder Uni work?

You can enrol in Tinder Uni by following some simple steps in the app.

Open the Tinder app on your phone and press the profile icon.

Click "edit profile" and scroll to the "education" tab to add your university.

Once you've added your uni, you can then tap on the "apply for Tinder Uni" option.

You'll need to verify your student status by adding and confirming your email address. That email address needs to end in ac.uk.

Once you've enrolled, you university colours will show up on your profile to show fellow uni daters where you study.

Per Tinder research, 53 percent of graduates in the UK met a current or previous partner while studying and 62 percent of those are still together with that partner.

It's already been clearly established that Prince Aemond Targaryen (Ewan Mitchell) is a strong contender for most dramatic character in House of the Dragon.

He's sinister, he's volatile, he has a cool leather eyepatch, and he clearly takes great delight in menacing the nephews who once bullied him for not having a dragon when he was younger.

In the finale, though, he takes things to a whole other level — and in doing so he may have revealed a small clue as to the direction the show is headed.

What happens with Aemond in the finale?

When we said he takes the drama to another level, we weren't exaggerating.

It starts when poor old Lucerys Velayron (Elliot Grihault) arrives at Storm's End to try and win support for his mother Rhaenyra (Emma D'Arcy), only to find Aemond has beaten him to it. Realising his mission is futile, Lucerys attempts to leave — only for Aemond to make a chilling demand.

"I want you to put out your eye, as payment for mine," he says, referring to the childhood fight they had back in episode 7 that resulted in Aemond losing his left eye.

At the same time he whips off his eye patch, and – in true dramatic Aemond fashion – reveals a gleaming blue sapphire where his eye used to be.

Lucerys refuses and leaves, and in the mid-air dragon fight that follows (resulting in Lucerys' death), it's easy to temporarily forget the sapphire beneath Aemond's eye patch.

But rather than just being more of Aemond's usual flair, is it possible the stone holds a deeper meaning?

What does the sapphire mean?

First, let's address the dragon in the room — we've seen gleaming blue eyes like that before, haven't we? Obviously Aemond's is just a stone, but the similarity he now has to this guy can't only be a co-incidence:

Haven't seen you in a while Credit: HBO

Yep, that's the infamous Night King, one of the main antagonists in Game of Thrones. And although Aemond doesn't exactly look like him – he's not made of ice, for one – you have to admit his shiny new sapphire eye does bear a striking resemblance to those of Westeros' most infamous White Walker.

So assuming this isn't just an accident, what does it mean? Will there end up being some connection to Aemond and the land beyond the Wall?

Featured Video For You 'Game of Thrones' star Lena Headey reveals she was 'gutted' by Cersei's death

Honestly, probably not. We doubt it'll be that literal. If we had to guess, though, we'd say that Aemond's sapphire eye serves two purposes: 1) To emphasise that Aemond is now a cold-hearted monster, capable of terrorising his younger relatives with minimal remorse, and 2) To draw even more attention to the Song of Ice and Fire prophecy that's been hanging over Season 1 like a shadow.

Viserys is obsessed with Aegon the Conqueror's dream of "a terrible winter" — so much so that he ends up accidentally starting a war by muttering about it on his death bed. The prophecy is mentioned again in the finale by Rhaenyra, who clearly hasn't forgotten her father's warning.

Clearly, the idea of a threat beyond the Wall will play at least some role in what's to come in House of the Dragon. Is it possible that Aemond's sapphire eye is there to intentionally remind us of the icy villains from Game of Thrones? Maybe even as a way of preparing us to see them again?

We'll have to wait for Season 2 to find out.

The news lately is a real roller coaster. All you wanted from Quordle was a little distraction, and it turned out to be a difficult one. Sorry.

If Quordle is a little too challenging today, you've come to the right place for hints. There aren't just hints here, but the whole Quordle solution. Scroll to the bottom of this page, and there it is. But are you sure you need all four answers? Maybe you just need a strategy guide. Either way, scroll down, and you'll get what you need.

What is Quordle?

Quordle is a five-letter word guessing game similar to Wordle, except each guess applies letters to four words at the same time. You get nine guesses instead of six to correctly guess all four words. It looks like playing four Wordle games at the same time, and that is essentially what it is. But it's not nearly as intimidating as it sounds.

Is Quordle harder than Wordle?

Yes, though not diabolically so.

Where did Quordle come from?

Amid the Wordle boom of late 2021 and early 2022, when everyone was learning to love free, in-browser, once-a-day word guessing games, creator Freddie Meyer says he took inspiration from one of the first big Wordle variations, Dordle — the one where you essentially play two Wordles at once. He took things up a notch, and released Quordle on January 30. Meyer's creation was covered in The Guardian six days later, and now, according to Meyer, it attracts millions of daily users. Today, Meyer earns modest revenue from Patreon, where dedicated Quordle fans can donate to keep their favorite puzzle game running.

How is Quordle pronounced?

“Kwordle.” It should rhyme with “Wordle,” and definitely should not be pronounced exactly like "curdle.”

Is Quordle strategy different from Wordle?

Yes and no.

Your starting strategy should be the same as with Wordle. In fact, if you have a favorite Wordle opening word, there’s no reason to change that here. We suggest something rich in vowels, featuring common letters like C, R, and N. But you do you.

After your first guess, however, you’ll notice things getting out of control if you play Quordle exactly like Wordle.

What should I do in Quordle that I don’t do in Wordle?

Solving a Wordle puzzle can famously come down to a series of single letter-change variations. If you’ve narrowed it down to “-IGHT,” you could guess “MIGHT” “NIGHT” “LIGHT” and “SIGHT” and one of those will probably be the solution — though this is also a famous way to end up losing in Wordle, particularly if you play on “hard mode.” In Quordle, however, this sort of single-letter winnowing is a deadly trap, and it hints at the important strategic difference between Wordle and Quordle: In Quordle, you can't afford to waste guesses unless you're eliminating as many letters as possible at all times.

Guessing a completely random word that you already know isn't the solution, just to eliminate three or four possible letters you haven’t tried yet, is thought of as a desperate, latch-ditch move in Wordle. In Quordle, however, it's a normal part of the player's strategic toolset.

Is there a way to get the answer faster?

In my experience Quordle can be a slow game, sometimes dragging out longer than it would take to play Wordle four times. But a sort of blunt-force guessing approach can speed things up. The following strategy also works with Wordle if you only want the solution, and don’t care about having the fewest possible guesses:

Try starting with a series of words that puts all the vowels (including Y) on the board, along with some other common letters. We've had good luck with the three words: “NOTES,” “ACRID,” and “LUMPY.” YouTuber DougMansLand suggests four words: “CANOE,” “SKIRT,” “PLUMB,” and “FUDGY.”

Most of the alphabet is now eliminated, and you’ll only have the ability to make one or two wrong guesses if you use this strategy. But in most cases you’ll have all the information you need to guess the remaining words without any wrong guesses.

If strategy isn't helping, and you're still stumped, here are some hints:

Are there any double or triple letters in today’s Quordle words?

Two words have recurring letters today.

Are any rare letters being used in today’s Quordle like Q or Z?

No.

What do today’s Quordle words start with?

S, D, M, and S.

What are the answers for today’s Quordle?

Are you sure you want to know?

If you just want today's word, you can jump straight to the end of this article for October 25's Wordle solution, for puzzle #493. If you'd rather work through it yourself, keep reading for some tips, tricks, and clues.

Where did Wordle come from?

Wordle was initially created by engineer Josh Wardle as a gift for his partner, though it quickly spread until it became an international phenomenon. Thousands of players across the globe tackle Wordle each day, with some fans even having created alternate versions of the daily word puzzle game. These include battle royale format Squabble, music identification game Heardle, and variations like Dordle and Quordle that make you guess multiple words at once.

The popularity of Wordle even reached such heights that the New York Times bought it earlier this year, while TikTok creators live-stream themselves playing it.

What's the best Wordle starting word?

The goal of Wordle is to have fun, and there's no right way to have fun. Just choose whatever starting word feels right to you, and don't let anyone shame you for it. However, if you want to take a more strategic approach, we have a few ideas to help you pick a word that will spark joy. One tip is to select a word that includes at least two different vowels, plus some common consonants like S, T, R, or N.

What happened to the Wordle archive?

The entire archive of past Wordles used to be available for anyone to play in glorious days gone by. Unfortunately it has since been taken down, with the website's creator stating it was done at the request of the New York Times.

Is Wordle getting harder?

If you're finding Wordle too easy, you can try enabling its Hard Mode to give your brain a tougher challenge. But Wordle isn't getting any harder by itself — it's the same difficulty that it's always been.

Why are there two different Wordle answers some days?

Wordle is a fun, collective experience specifically because everyone's solving for the same word every day. Occasionally, though, Wordle has accepted two different solutions as correct on the same day. This is because the New York Times made changes to the Wordle word list after acquiring it, and sometimes swaps out words from the original list. To ensure you're getting the right answer every day, refresh your browser before you play — the site will save your streak.

Here's a subtle hint for today's Wordle answer:

Are we in London?

Distract yourself from next week's bulk-bought Halloween candy taunting you from the pantry with today's Wordle! Feel like today's puzzle is more trick than treat? Never fear, we've got some clues and the solution to help you out, as we do every day.

If you just want today's word, you can jump straight to the end of this article for October 25's Wordle solution, for puzzle #493. If you'd rather work through it yourself, keep reading for some tips, tricks, and clues.

Where did Wordle come from?

Wordle was initially created by engineer Josh Wardle as a gift for his partner, though it quickly spread until it became an international phenomenon. Thousands of players across the globe tackle Wordle each day, with some fans even having created alternate versions of the daily word puzzle game. These include battle royale format Squabble, music identification game Heardle, and variations like Dordle and Quordle that make you guess multiple words at once.

The popularity of Wordle even reached such heights that the New York Times bought it earlier this year, while TikTok creators live-stream themselves playing it.

What's the best Wordle starting word?

The goal of Wordle is to have fun, and there's no right way to have fun. Just choose whatever starting word feels right to you, and don't let anyone shame you for it. However, if you want to take a more strategic approach, we have a few ideas to help you pick a word that will spark joy. One tip is to select a word that includes at least two different vowels, plus some common consonants like S, T, R, or N.

What happened to the Wordle archive?

The entire archive of past Wordles used to be available for anyone to play in glorious days gone by. Unfortunately it has since been taken down, with the website's creator stating it was done at the request of the New York Times.

Is Wordle getting harder?

If you're finding Wordle too easy, you can try enabling its Hard Mode to give your brain a tougher challenge. But Wordle isn't getting any harder by itself — it's the same difficulty that it's always been.

Why are there two different Wordle answers some days?

Wordle is a fun, collective experience specifically because everyone's solving for the same word every day. Occasionally, though, Wordle has accepted two different solutions as correct on the same day. This is because the New York Times made changes to the Wordle word list after acquiring it, and sometimes swaps out words from the original list. To ensure you're getting the right answer every day, refresh your browser before you play — the site will save your streak.

Here's a subtle hint for today's Wordle answer:

The years-long saga involving a controversial global mobile telecom giant just got even more contentious.

In a press conference on Monday, the U.S. Department of Justice detailed newly-unsealed charges against two alleged spies from China. According to the DOJ brief, Chinese intelligence officers Guochun He and Zheng Wang had attempted to obstruct an ongoing criminal investigation of a "global telecommunications company" based in China through bribery and espionage.

While the DOJ said outright that it would not name the company in question, CNN as well as other news outlets have confirmed the entity is the China-based Huawei. The telecommunications company has long been accused of providing backdoors in their mobile devices in order to facilitate China's ability to spy on governments, business competitors, and other users throughout the world. The U.S. has previously restricted Huawei's ability to conduct business in the U.S. due to these security concerns.

Starting in 2017, the two alleged spies had begun cultivating a relationship with an employee of a U.S. law enforcement agency in order to extract information from the individual regarding evidence, witnesses, and potential charges in a criminal case against Huawei. In exchange for U.S. prosecutors' confidential documents about the case, the U.S. government employee was paid tens of thousands of dollars in Bitcoin. In total, $61,000 was paid by the spies, with the most recent transaction occurring just this month.

What the spies did not know, however, was that their contact was actually working as a double agent the whole time under the FBI's supervision.

Perhaps in an attempt to show how serious the U.S. is taking this issue, Monday's press conference included the biggest names within the DOJ, such as U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland and Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco, as well as FBI Director Christopher Wray. The press conference was billed to be about a "significant national security matter" before the details were released.

Monaco actually had a bit of an online moment during the press conference, as some internet users latched onto her use of the phrase "Team America" while discussing the double agent. "Team America" is, of course, the name of the 2004 comedy film by South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone.

Another separate case involving China was brought up during the press conference as the DOJ has also charged Chinese nationals who attempted to force a dissident back to China.

One interesting note to be made about the press conference was each speakers' insistence on referring to China as the People's Republic of China or the PRC. In fact, FBI Director Wray even went on to specifically note that the issue is with the Chinese government and its role here.

"Know that our quarrel is with the Chinese government…not the Chinese people," he stated.

It's unclear at this time exactly what Huawei's connection was with the spies, Guochun He and Zheng Wang. However, during the conference, officials said there is an allegation of involvement from a director at the China-based company.

He and Wang both remain at large.

Henry Cavill, the Man of Steel himself, confirmed in an Instagram video that he will be returning to the DCEU as Superman. The announcement comes after Superman made a cameo appearance in the mid-credits scene of Black Adam.

"I wanted to wait until the weekend was over before posting this because I wanted to give you all a chance to watch Black Adam," Cavill explained in the video. "But now that plenty of you have, I wanted to make it official: I am back as Superman."

Black Adam marks Cavill's latest outing as Superman since 2021's Zack Snyder's Justice League. The character also made a brief appearance in 2019's Shazam!, but since it was only a quick shot of that iconic red and blue suit, Cavill didn't actually appear. Now, after much speculation and pleading from fans, Cavill has donned the superhero tights once again.

"A very small taste of what’s to come, my friends," reads Cavill's Instagram caption. "The dawn of hope renewed. Thank you for your patience, it will be rewarded."

Clearly, the DCEU isn't done with Superman just yet. What the future holds in store is still a mystery, but based on his appearance in Black Adam and Dwayne Johnson's desire to see Black Adam and Superman fight, it looks like we're headed for a major superpowered showdown. Here's hoping this one doesn't end with Black Adam and Superman realizing their mothers have the same name.

The Season 1 finale of House of the Dragon ended with a devastating, dragon-toothed crunch that shook the realm and set in motion the Targaryen civil war known as the Dance of the Dragons. But with that epic cliffhanger comes the horrifying realization that we have to wait for Season 2 to find out what will happen next.

The hiatus may be dark and full of terrors, but we do have some inkling about when we can expect our next dose of House of the Dragon. Plus, based on the show's source material, George R.R. Martin's Fire & Blood, we have a few predictions as to the chaos coming our way. Here's what we know so far about Season 2.

What is the release date for House of the Dragon Season 2?

More dragon fights incoming! (At some point.) Credit: Courtesy of HBO

The good news? HBO has already renewed House of the Dragon for a second season. The bad news? We don't know the exact release date. However, we do have a good idea of when production is starting. In late September, Spanish newspaper Hoy reported that House of the Dragon would return to the town of Cáceres — which serves as King's Landing — for filming starting in spring 2023.

Given the amount of time it takes to produce a television season of this magnitude, this production schedule means we won't be seeing more of the Targaryens until 2024 at the earliest. We'll just have to sit tight and await any casting or production announcements HBO will send our way until then.

Here's what happens next in Fire & Blood

All hail the Black Queen! Credit: Ollie Upton/HBO

If you absolutely need to know what happens after Rhaenyra (Emma D'Arcy) dons her war face at the end of Season 1, you've come to the right place. House of the Dragon has been mostly faithful to its source material so far, so I'm fairly confident that it will continue to adhere to the book in the aftermath of the death of Lucerys (Elliot Grihault). I'll be going full spoilers here, so if you don't want to know the future of the Dance of the Dragons, turn away now.

Rhaenyra and Daemon (Matt Smith) will retaliate against Alicent (Olivia Cooke) and her family in a big way. The Blacks will attempt to shore up their forces by finding riders for riderless dragons like Vermithor and Seasmoke. Meanwhile, Daemon will attack Harrenhal on dragonback and win it without bloodshed, striking a major blow to the Greens. In Fire & Blood, this attack happens while Jacaerys (Harry Collett) and Lucerys are on their missions. Now, with the tragedy of Luc's death fueling Daemon, it's highly likely the show's version of the attack at Harrenhal will be on the more violent side.

And the violence will only continue! Because Daemon's next move in the book is among the most horrifying events in Westerosi history. (If you're having any doubts about spoilers, now's definitely the time to turn back.) Using his connections to the underbelly of King's Landing, Daemon enlists the help of two unsavory characters known only as Blood and Cheese. They attack the Red Keep and force Queen Helaena (Phia Saban) to choose which of her sons they will kill. They then proceed to murder the son she doesn't name. The attack is Daemon's doing in Fire & Blood, but given the rage in Rhaenyra's eyes at the end of the finale, is there a chance she'll get involved as well?

As chaos rages down south, Jace will travel north to the Eyrie and beyond, to Winterfell. On his trip north, he'll secure allies from Houses like the Arryns and the Manderlys. He will also befriend Lord Cregan Stark and win him to Rhaenyra's cause. So you can expect a mixed bag of sorts from the start of House of the Dragon Season 2. On the one hand, we get the Starks back. On the other, we get more traumatic child murder.

Brace yourselves, fellow viewers: Our wait may be long, but the coming Dance will be one heck of a jig.

Bono is really sorry for that time he forced U2's album onto everyone's iTunes library.

In an excerpt from his memoir published in The Guardian, Bono, the lead singer of U2, looks back on the band's ill-fated 2014 collaboration with Apple that he thought would be the ultimate rock n' roll move. Instead, it became a PR nightmare for the tech company and made U2 look like aging has-beens desperate for an audience.

The idea, of course, was to permanently add U2's then-new album Songs of Innocence to the iTunes libraries of 500 million users worldwide... with no ability to remove it. The backlash, as you might imagine, was swift and unambiguous. "Woke up this morning to find Bono in my kitchen, drinking my coffee, wearing my dressing gown, reading my paper," recounts Bono of one social media reaction at the time. "The free U2 album is overpriced."

Ouch.

Ever the altruist, Bono has accepted the blame for this infamously terrible idea. He thought delivering U2's album to iTunes users — an album which was free of charge because Apple bought it ahead of time per the agreement — would be something people could enjoy or ignore, "like junk mail." Instead, iTunes users felt violated.

The outrage got so bad at one point that Apple even had to build a specific tool for removing the free U2 album.

"We realized we’d bumped into a serious discussion about the access of big tech to our lives," said Bono in his memoir. "The part of me that will always be punk rock thought this was exactly what the Clash would do. Subversive. But subversive is hard to claim when you’re working with a company that’s about to be the biggest on Earth."

SEE ALSO: Apple launches Music Sessions with live performances in Spatial Audio

Part of the reason for the outrage was because Songs of Innocence was taking up precious storage space in iTunes users' carefully cultivated music libraries. Nowadays, the ubiquity of streaming platforms means we don't have to painstakingly manage and budget what media we download to consume. But back in 2014, people were only just starting to pony up for paid Spotify subscriptions.

To his credit, Bono says in the memoir that Cook could've said "told you so," but instead took the debacle as a learned lesson and went into problem-solving mode.

"It was not just a banana skin. It was a landmine," said Bono.

We'd add 'pie to the face' to that list, too.

Playing cross-platform games with your friends on PlayStation 5 may get easier in the near future.

Just a few months after Discord started rolling out voice chat features to Xbox owners, it looks like Sony’s next-gen console is getting the same treatment. A Sunday tweet from “advaith,” a Twitter user who regularly posts about upcoming Discord features, showcased a bundle of the app's new PlayStation-centric features, most notably the ability to join Discord voice chats via a PS5 console.

That may be easy enough to Photoshop, but a screenshot of the exact same menu also appeared on Reddit over the weekend courtesy of user Syhix. Based on this leak, it appears users will be able to connect a PlayStation Network account to Discord to enable voice chats as well as display which PS5 game you’re playing on your Discord profile, the latter of which has been an existing option since at least January.

Crucially, voice chats appear to be available only on PS5, meaning PS4 owners need to stick with the console's built-in party chat system if they want to hear game audio and their friends’ banter at the same time. PlayStation first announced a partnership with Discord in 2021, but now a year and a half later, voice chat still hasn’t been released or even officially confirmed.

The closest thing we have to a date comes courtesy of reporter Tom Henderson, who has a track record of seemingly valid leaks, including a recent report that the PS5 would get a detachable disc drive. According to Henderson, Discord won't add PS5 integration until a system update sometime in March of 2023. So, in other words, it could be a little while.

Apple has always been shy when it comes to bright, vivid colors. Gadgets with the Apple logo are traditionally some shade of gray, and even those that come in a wider variety of colors are typically quite subdued.

As you can see in our analysis of pink gadget history here, Apple has mostly reserved the pink color for its iPod range of products. The iPhones that did get the pink treatment – namely, the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 mini – were…well, not very pink.

As for the Rose Gold iPhones of yesteryear, some of us called them "pink" but let's face it, that was a long, long time ago (the iPhone that introduced the Rose Gold color for Apple was iPhone 6s, which launched in 2015), and it wasn't true pink.

Same goes for the iPad. For example, you can get the latest iPad Air in pink, but it barely looks pink even in Apple’s own official images. It's as if you took the color pink and drained all the fun out of it.

This ends now. Apple’s new iPad, which hits the market on October 26, comes in four colors: Blue, Silver, Yellow, and Pink, and the colors are more vibrant and vivid than ever before.

Product images are one thing, but Apple sent me a Pink iPad to play with, and I can attest: it is truly, properly, triumphantly pink. Just look at it:

And you can even get a matching cover for it! I didn’t get to see that one (Apple sent me an off-white, new Magic Keyboard for the iPad instead), but its color is called Watermelon. While it doesn’t appears to be exactly as pink as the device itself, it’s close enough.

Does all this mean Apple will finally relent and give us a hot pink iPhone next year? No one knows, but at least it shows the company is open to the possibility. If all else fails, you can always get that pink iPad and hide your bland-colored phone behind it.
Apple has always been shy when it comes to bright, vivid colors. Gadgets with the Apple logo are traditionally some shade of gray, and even those that come in a wider variety of colors are typically quite subdued.

As you can see in our analysis of pink gadget history here, Apple has mostly reserved the pink color for its iPod range of products. The iPhones that did get the pink treatment – namely, the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 mini – were…well, not very pink.

As for the Rose Gold iPhones of yesteryear, some of us called them "pink" but let's face it, that was a long, long time ago (the iPhone that introduced the Rose Gold color for Apple was iPhone 6s, which launched in 2015), and it wasn't true pink.

Same goes for the iPad. For example, you can get the latest iPad Air in pink, but it barely looks pink even in Apple’s own official images. It's as if you took the color pink and drained all the fun out of it.

People have had a fascination with famous people for eons — and in the age of the internet, it's only increased. Influencers , often online content creators, have made both the definition of "celebrity" and our relationships with them fuzzy.

While it may seem like influencers are followers' friends due to how they interact with them online, this more than likely isn't the case. Instead, these relationships are parasocial — one-sided. But what are parasocial relationships exactly, and are they healthy?

What are parasocial relationships?

Parasocial relationships are one-sided relationships, typically with an everyday individual and a celebrity or fictional character, said assistant professor of communication at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, Natalie Pennington.

According to chief strategy officer at media tech company IMGN Media Noah Mallin, parasocial relationships are an assumed intimacy audience members feel even though they don't have an actual relationship with that person.

These relationships existed long before the internet — thousands of years ago. Researchers say ancient people had parasocial relationships with pharaohs and deities, for example.

In the 20th century, early research on parasocial relationships dissected those of people and soap opera characters and other fictional TV characters. "People would watch TV shows and become really invested in, and feel like they had a relationship with…some of the leads on the shows," said Pennington. "So even though they may never meet, they were like, 'This person is my friend. I know them.'"

"Even though they may never meet, they were like, 'This person is my friend. I know them.'"

As media and technology has evolved, so have parasocial relationships. With the rise of the internet and social media in the past few decades, celebrities have disclosed more information about themselves online, allowing fans more insight. This previously-impossible-to-know knowledge has made these relationships seem real, as fans are learning more about the celebrity. It's still one-sided, however, as the celebrity may have no idea who the fan is.

Examples of parasocial relationships

In a study on fan-celebrity interaction on Twitter Pennington published in 2016 with professor Jeffrey A. Hall and researcher Alex Hutchinson, the authors discussed the "illusion of closeness" social media interaction gives to fans when it comes to celebrity interaction. A celebrity "like" or retweet can not only boost one's own social status, but it's a perceived level of intimacy with the celeb.

Even the definition of "celebrity" is fuzzy these days due to the rise of social media and particularly influencers, who've blurred the parasocial lines even more because of increased interaction and the perception that an influencer is just a "normal person" like yourself.

Because of engagement, social media blurs the line of parasocial relationships. Since that study, it's only increased — especially with TikTok, Pennington noted. Referring to the stitch feature of combining videos, she said, "TikTok with stitching, for example…it blurs the line on parasocial because someone may actually respond to you and then you can feel even more connected."

The rise of YouTube vlogging had a hand in modern parasocial relationships, said Mallin. Vloggers speak directly to camera (something not often done in previous forms of media) about specific personal issues they're dealing with, as if they're speaking to a friend. Now it's typical for an influencer to look directly at you during a video. There's a perceived level of authenticity there, even if a lot of work went into a video behind the scenes.

Not only are influencers looking at you, but they're also interacting — sometimes in real time. "It feels like you've got more ability to access and interact," said Mallin. "A good creator will read the comments, and comment back."

Commenting back and forth can feel like you're having a conversation with an influencer (even if it's their team and not them responding). This helps foster the sense of "this is a real person," said Mallin, "but that can also foster the sense of, 'not only is this a real person, but we actually have a relationship with each other,'" even though you don't.

"Again, [this is] still not a two sided relationship in most cases," Pennington said. "But because there's that extra level of interaction or potential for [interaction], it can strengthen that tie for someone."

How do parasocial relationships form and end?

Parasocial relationships are born out of parasocial interaction, or PSI. PSI is the process of engaging with a celebrity or influencer. You watch their content, perhaps even reach out to them. It's likely you relate to them in some way; maybe their identity aligns with yours, or maybe you share similar attitudes.

Just as possible as it is for parasocial relationships to form, it's also possible for them to end. The most morbid of cases is when the public figure dies, but that's not the only way.

One way is, as Mallin said, "the bubble has burst." This is especially the case of influencers when they reach a certain level of notoriety where they don't "feel real" anymore. Perhaps their follow count is in the millions, and they've entered the mainstream. "Once you get the sense that they're not really talking to just you anymore…it can start to feel like less of a relationship," said Mallin.

This can also be the case if an influencer starts doing too many sponsorships that feel misaligned with who they are (or, at least, who the fan believe them to be). "It starts to feel less authentic," said Mallin.

Or, maybe the influencer started in one niche that resonated with you and then they evolved and moved on. In that way, the end of a parasocial relationship can feel like a friendship that drifted apart.

This doesn't happen with all fans, but parasocial relationships can fizzle when the illusion of intimacy is somehow broken.

Are parasocial relationships healthy?

The simple answer is yes — but like most things, it's best in moderation.

In the United States, people are pretty lonely, and the pandemic worsened the "loneliness epidemic." People have fewer close friends now than they did decades ago. At the same time, Pennington said, there's an innate human need to belong and thus a need for connection, and when we don't have that we'll seek it out. Humans evolved these needs over millions of years, because we needed to be part of groups in order to survive. While this isn't necessarily the case anymore, we're still social creatures who thrive with others.

So, it makes sense that people seek connection online and through celebrities and influencers. As long as they're not the only relationships in your life, parasocial relationships can be totally fine. You may get a "boost" of good-connection feelings — a hit of the feel-good chemical dopamine — when you engage with your favorite online personality, and that's a positive.

But if that's the only way you're connecting — or if you think your parasocial relationship is actually two-sided — that's when they can get problematic.

"We need people in our life that we actively talk to," Pennington said, "to help our wellbeing, whether that be loneliness, self esteem, belonging, connection, all that stuff."

Pennington continued, "There's nothing wrong with enjoying the content of a creator in any capacity and appreciating the work they do with the in-the-moment joy that that brings you." It's not a good idea to set expectations with the celebrity, however. "It's okay to reach out to tweet at and say 'hi,' but not anticipate or expect a response," Pennington said.

Further, Mallin said, parasocial relationships can cross the line into being toxic, especially if the influencer/celebrity is of a marginalized identity. "Parasocial relationships can feel fairly benign," he said, "but for some groups that sometimes can be a little bit more sinister."

During the worst of the pandemic, for example, influencers spoke out about increased harassment . Abuse can escalate from online to offline, such as Twitch "fans" stalking streamers . In these ways, the blurred line of interaction can be detrimental.

When interacting with an influencer/celebrity, it's important to remember the relationship is indeed one-sided. It's okay to love a famous person — but keep your emotional and physical distance.

And just like that, it's over.

On Sunday night, House of the Dragon delivered its tenth and final episode of the first season, leaving us on the precipice of a civil war between the Hightowers and the usurped Queen Rhaenyra.

Unsurprisingly, there was a lot of stuff to unpack — but the biggest moment of the finale had to be poor old Lucerys being casually chomped in half by Aemond's dragon Vhagar while he attempted to escape through the clouds on Arrax.

The whole thing comes about because Aemond is trying to taunt Lucerys – it's not clear that he actually wants to harm him – and a presumably-disconcerted Arrax breathes fire at Vhagar. The bigger dragon then retaliates with the aforementioned chomp, despite Aemond's failed attempts to control it.

The lesson? Dragons can't be tamed, at least not to the point where you're fully confident they won't go eating your relatives and escalating deadly wars.

The thing is, though, we should have seen it coming. King Viserys basically warned us what was going to happen back in Episode 1.

The moment takes place in the bowels of the castle, when King Viserys summons his daughter and tells her to look at the skull of Balerion, the great dragon ridden by Aegon I Targaryen during the Conquest. He asks her what she sees.

"Everyone says Targaryens are closer to gods than to men. But they say that because of our dragons. Without them we're just like everyone else," is Rhaenyra's response.

"The idea that we control the dragons is an illusion," replies Viserys. "They're a power men should never have trifled with. One that brought Valyria its doom. And if we don't mind our own histories it would do the same to us."

Viserys is about to name Rhaenyra his heir, and at the time it feels like what he's saying is a metaphor for the dangers of power. But clearly, the meaning is also literal — and almost prophetic.

The Targaryens' lack of real control over dragons ends up causing the death of Rhaenyra's son Lucerys in the show's finale, an act that will almost certainly escalate the civil war between Rhaenyra and the Hightowers.

If Viserys' children aren't careful, the uncontrollable power of the dragons might well be the catalyst that brings about their own destruction.

Doctor Who introduced its Fourteenth Doctor on Sunday night in the UK, ending Jodie Whittaker's five-year tenure as the Time Lord's thirteenth incarnation. The Doctor's regeneration wasn't a surprise to anyone, with Whittaker's exit announced well in advance last year. We've also known since May that Sex Education actor Ncuti Gatwa would soon be stepping into the role of Doctor.

Warning: Spoilers for Doctor Who follow.

However, an unexpected twist still managed to shock viewers, and has long-time fans absolutely ecstatic.

Though if you're a Whovian, chances are it's been all over your Twitter feed.

Written by outgoing showrunner Chris Chibnall, "The Power of the Doctor" was the last of three Doctor Who specials that had been scheduled for 2022. The episode had the Thirteenth Doctor tangle with classic adversaries such as the Daleks and the Master (Sacha Dhawan); reunited her with former companions like Tegan Jovanka (Janet Fielding) and Ace (Sophie Aldred); and even had a few of her former incarnations poke their heads in, including the Fifth (Peter Davidson) and Seventh (Sylvester McCoy) Doctors.

Still, the biggest surprise and delight of the episode was its final scene, in which Whittaker's Thirteenth Doctor tags in the next Doctor and finally regenerates — into David Tennant, not Gatwa.

Featured Video For You Google Earth lets you time travel now

Tennant previously played the Tenth Doctor from 2005 to 2010, with his run widely lauded by both critics and fans. Arguably the most beloved Doctor since the sci-fi series' revival in 2005, his ongoing love for the series is well known and has been widely documented. Even so, nobody expected Tennant to return as Doctor Who's protagonist, or even believed it possible under the show's lore.

It seems we all forgot a core tenet of Doctor Who: Nothing is impossible. Just a bit unlikely.

With former showrunner Russell T. Davis also returning to Doctor Who, fans are hopeful the Fourteenth Doctor's run will be full of the same camp fun that first hooked them on the series.

It's already offered more than one callback at the very least. Upon regenerating on Sunday, Tennant's Fourteenth Doctor immediately commented that he "know[s] these teeth," a reference to his first lines as the Tenth Doctor. He also repeated "what" several times in bafflement, a signature of the character.

The nostalgia will be further bolstered by the Tenth Doctor's former companion Donna Noble (Catherine Tate) also returning to the show. Though Tennant and Tate's returns to Doctor Who were announced in September, many fans reasonably assumed it'd be in a flashback, missing story, or even a parallel universe. Now it seems possible we could find out what the best temp in Chiswick has been up to all these years.

Tennant's return has been widely celebrated, however it was a bit of a blow to anyone looking forward to seeing Gatwa in the TARDIS this year. Fortunately, Doctor Who's regeneration twist doesn't mean he's been shafted from the job.

Gatwa will take up the sonic screwdriver as the series' Fifteenth Doctor after Tennant's second run, which will feature the Fourteenth Doctor in three special episodes scheduled to air in November next year. These episodes will celebrate Doctor Who's 60th anniversary.

Notably, the May announcement that Gatwa would be portraying the Doctor stopped short of specifically naming him the Fourteenth Doctor. This omission seems rather telling in retrospect — particularly when compared to the wording in other Doctors' casting announcements.

Of course, there wasn't enough evidence to draw any strong conclusions at the time. But it seems the careful wording left just enough of a crack for the Doctor's particular brand of mischief to wiggle through.

Monday should be an easy day for Quordle. It's hard enough starting work again. But alas...

If Quordle is a little too challenging today, you've come to the right place for hints. There aren't just hints here, but the whole Quordle solution. Scroll to the bottom of this page, and there it is. But are you sure you need all four answers? Maybe you just need a strategy guide. Either way, scroll down, and you'll get what you need.

What is Quordle?

Quordle is a five-letter word guessing game similar to Wordle, except each guess applies letters to four words at the same time. You get nine guesses instead of six to correctly guess all four words. It looks like playing four Wordle games at the same time, and that is essentially what it is. But it's not nearly as intimidating as it sounds.

Is Quordle harder than Wordle?

Yes, though not diabolically so.

Where did Quordle come from?

Amid the Wordle boom of late 2021 and early 2022, when everyone was learning to love free, in-browser, once-a-day word guessing games, creator Freddie Meyer says he took inspiration from one of the first big Wordle variations, Dordle — the one where you essentially play two Wordles at once. He took things up a notch, and released Quordle on January 30. Meyer's creation was covered in The Guardian six days later, and now, according to Meyer, it attracts millions of daily users. Today, Meyer earns modest revenue from Patreon, where dedicated Quordle fans can donate to keep their favorite puzzle game running.

How is Quordle pronounced?

“Kwordle.” It should rhyme with “Wordle,” and definitely should not be pronounced exactly like "curdle.”

Is Quordle strategy different from Wordle?

Yes and no.

Your starting strategy should be the same as with Wordle. In fact, if you have a favorite Wordle opening word, there’s no reason to change that here. We suggest something rich in vowels, featuring common letters like C, R, and N. But you do you.

After your first guess, however, you’ll notice things getting out of control if you play Quordle exactly like Wordle.

What should I do in Quordle that I don’t do in Wordle?

Solving a Wordle puzzle can famously come down to a series of single letter-change variations. If you’ve narrowed it down to “-IGHT,” you could guess “MIGHT” “NIGHT” “LIGHT” and “SIGHT” and one of those will probably be the solution — though this is also a famous way to end up losing in Wordle, particularly if you play on “hard mode.” In Quordle, however, this sort of single-letter winnowing is a deadly trap, and it hints at the important strategic difference between Wordle and Quordle: In Quordle, you can't afford to waste guesses unless you're eliminating as many letters as possible at all times.

Guessing a completely random word that you already know isn't the solution, just to eliminate three or four possible letters you haven’t tried yet, is thought of as a desperate, latch-ditch move in Wordle. In Quordle, however, it's a normal part of the player's strategic toolset.

Is there a way to get the answer faster?

In my experience Quordle can be a slow game, sometimes dragging out longer than it would take to play Wordle four times. But a sort of blunt-force guessing approach can speed things up. The following strategy also works with Wordle if you only want the solution, and don’t care about having the fewest possible guesses:

Try starting with a series of words that puts all the vowels (including Y) on the board, along with some other common letters. We've had good luck with the three words: “NOTES,” “ACRID,” and “LUMPY.” YouTuber DougMansLand suggests four words: “CANOE,” “SKIRT,” “PLUMB,” and “FUDGY.”

Most of the alphabet is now eliminated, and you’ll only have the ability to make one or two wrong guesses if you use this strategy. But in most cases you’ll have all the information you need to guess the remaining words without any wrong guesses.

If strategy isn't helping, and you're still stumped, here are some hints:

Are there any double or triple letters in today’s Quordle words?

No.

Are any rare letters being used in today’s Quordle like Q or Z?

No.

What do today’s Quordle words start with?

S, T, T, and S.

What are the answers for today’s Quordle?

Are you sure you want to know?

There’s still time to turn back.

OK, you asked for it. The answers are:
Monday should be an easy day for Quordle. It's hard enough starting work again. But alas...

If Quordle is a little too challenging today, you've come to the right place for hints. There aren't just hints here, but the whole Quordle solution. Scroll to the bottom of this page, and there it is. But are you sure you need all four answers? Maybe you just need a strategy guide. Either way, scroll down, and you'll get what you need.

What is Quordle?

Quordle is a five-letter word guessing game similar to Wordle, except each guess applies letters to four words at the same time. You get nine guesses instead of six to correctly guess all four words. It looks like playing four Wordle games at the same time, and that is essentially what it is. But it's not nearly as intimidating as it sounds.

Is Quordle harder than Wordle?

Yes, though not diabolically so.

Where did Quordle come from?

Amid the Wordle boom of late 2021 and early 2022, when everyone was learning to love free, in-browser, once-a-day word guessing games, creator Freddie Meyer says he took inspiration from one of the first big Wordle variations, Dordle — the one where you essentially play two Wordles at once. He took things up a notch, and released Quordle on January 30. Meyer's creation was covered in The Guardian six days later, and now, according to Meyer, it attracts millions of daily users. Today, Meyer earns modest revenue from Patreon, where dedicated Quordle fans can donate to keep their favorite puzzle game running.

How is Quordle pronounced?

“Kwordle.” It should rhyme with “Wordle,” and definitely should not be pronounced exactly like "curdle.”

Is Quordle strategy different from Wordle?

Yes and no.

Your starting strategy should be the same as with Wordle. In fact, if you have a favorite Wordle opening word, there’s no reason to change that here. We suggest something rich in vowels, featuring common letters like C, R, and N. But you do you.

After your first guess, however, you’ll notice things getting out of control if you play Quordle exactly like Wordle.

What should I do in Quordle that I don’t do in Wordle?

Solving a Wordle puzzle can famously come down to a series of single letter-change variations. If you’ve narrowed it down to “-IGHT,” you could guess “MIGHT” “NIGHT” “LIGHT” and “SIGHT” and one of those will probably be the solution — though this is also a famous way to end up losing in Wordle, particularly if you play on “hard mode.” In Quordle, however, this sort of single-letter winnowing is a deadly trap, and it hints at the important strategic difference between Wordle and Quordle: In Quordle, you can't afford to waste guesses unless you're eliminating as many letters as possible at all times.

Guessing a completely random word that you already know isn't the solution, just to eliminate three or four possible letters you haven’t tried yet, is thought of as a desperate, latch-ditch move in Wordle. In Quordle, however, it's a normal part of the player's strategic toolset.

Welcome to House of the Dragon MVP, our series highlighting each episode's Most Valuable Player in the game before the Game of Thrones .

In the very first episode of House of the Dragon, King Viserys made an observation that might as well have been a prophecy. "The idea that we control the dragons is an illusion," he said, standing in the shadow of the black dragon Balerion's skull. "They're a power man should never have trifled with." Even though Viserys' track record with prophecies is essentially garbage, this one came true with the surprising House of the Dragon's Season 1 finale MVP.

This season's Most Valuable Players have included a hauntingly tragic queen , the guy crazy enough to take on an entire army by himself , two different forms of Rhaenyra, an arsonist who likes feet , Viserys doing one (1) thing right , and a grandmother engineering a mass casualty event . None of the MVPs in the first season of House of the Dragon have been an actual dragon…until now.

Give it up for Vhagar, oldest and largest of the Targaryen dragons, queen of making things worse, and devourer of Rhaenyra's sweet, strong son Prince Lucerys. It was she who turned what could have been a mildly traumatizing example of bullying into a civil war, kicking off an era-defining conflict that will kill thousands, and she did it with a smile.

Now, it's true Vhagar had help. Aemond was right there riding on her back for most of the chase. It's also true that when push came to shove, Vhagar ignored Aemond's commands and ate a teenager out of the sky all by herself. Aemond, cool as he is, is not the moment here.

Vhagar gets way more MVP points than Aemond because Vhagar made Aemond. Do you think Aemond could pull off looking like Sephiroth 's leathery godson if he couldn't back his drip up with the biggest dragon in the world? No. Do you think the wimpy boy who got pranked with a bedazzled pig would have mastered the blade if he didn't acquire some serious BDE (Big Dragon Energy)? Absolutely not. Aemond doesn't ride Vhagar. Vhagar puts Aemond in her backpack. And then she does whatever the hell she wants. Which, historically speaking, is to perform atrocities. Lots and lots of atrocities.

Vhagar's first rider was Queen Visenya , who kicked off Aegon's conquest by setting fire to the first of the war's many targets; eventually, burning entire towns and castles became her whole thing. Her second rider was Viserys and Daemon's father Baelon, a warrior known for being so stupidly brave he punched Balerion the Black Dread in the face when he was a literal baby. After Baelon came Laena, claiming an older, semi-retired Vhagar who seemed happy to take a break from all the state terrorism and religious persecution until Laena died.

Then Aemond claimed her and several years later he rode Vhagar to Storm's End, where the old she-dragon decided it was war crimes o'clock whether Aemond wanted it or not. "Serve!" cried Aemond in High Valyrian, heedless of the fact that she already was. "No!" he yelled as his majestic flying hell-lizard did what majestic flying hell-lizards do (eat children). He didn't have a chance. Vhagar Vhagared and once again changed the fate of all seven kingdoms.

Everything else that happens in House of the Dragon's later seasons — every betrayal, every retaliation, every battle, every death — will stem from the moment Vhagar attacked Lucerys. She makes history as easily as she makes fire, and the wars to come will be yet another chapter in the legend of Vhagar the dragon.

House of the Dragon season 1 is streaming on HBO Max.
After ten episodes, several time jumps, and way more dragons than we ever saw on Game of Thrones, Season 1 of House of the Dragon has come to an unforgettable end.

The season finale, "The Black Queen," picks up where the ninth episode, "The Green Council," left off. Princess Rhaenys (Eve Best) informs Princess Rhaenyra (Emma D'Arcy) that the Greens have disrespected her claim and usurped the Iron Throne. The rest of the episode sticks with the Black camp, following how they plan to proceed in the face of what will certainly be a war of succession.

Of course, this being Westeros, things don't quite play out how you'd expect, and there are several twists — and one devastating death — ahead. Let's break it down.

What is Rhaenyra's next move?

And so the Dance of Dragons begins. Credit: Ollie Upton/HBO

"The Black Queen" puts Rhaenyra through hell. She finds out that her father Viserys is dead and that Alicent (Olivia Cooke) put Aegon (Tom Glynn-Carney) on the Iron Throne, and then she goes into premature labor. She delivers a stillborn baby and has no time at all to mourn before she is crowned Queen by her supporters in Dragonstone.

In the midst of all this grief, Rhaenyra does her best to hold the realm together, as this is what Aegon the Conqueror's Song of Ice and Fire demands of a Targaryen leader. However, she does move to take stock of her allies. Once Corlys Velaryon (Steve Toussaint) recovers from his fever, he declares House Velaryon's support for her. With Corlys at her side, Rhaenyra has the advantage of the biggest fleet in Westeros, one that can cut off shipping lanes to King's Landing. If Rhaenyra could bind Houses Arryn, Tully, Stark, and Baratheon to her side, she would be truly unstoppable. She sends out her sons Jacaerys (Harry Collett) and Lucerys (Elliot Grihault) as messengers to these great lords. Jacaerys will treat with Cregan Stark, while Lucerys will remind Borros Baratheon of the oath his father swore to Rhaenyra years ago.

What does the piece of paper Otto gives Rhaenyra mean?

History repeats itself. Credit: Ollie Upton/HBO

Otto Hightower (Rhys Ifans) arrives on Dragonstone to deliver Rhaenyra terms for her accepting Aegon as king. He is met with a very hostile Daemon (Matt Smith) and Rhaenyra riding Syrax. The whole scene plays out like a mirror version of the Dragonstone standoff from episode 2. Once, Rhaenyra and Daemon were rivals threatening each other with dragons. Now, the two of them join together against Otto.

Just like with the last Dragonstone showdown, this tense encounter doesn't end in bloodshed, and it's all thanks to a message from Alicent. Otto hands Rhaenyra a piece of paper and she recognizes it immediately as a page from a history book that Alicent once quizzed her on, all the way back in episode 1. The fact that Alicent kept it all these years — and that Rhaenyra remembers — definitely speaks to the strength of their bond (as well as, dare I say it, deeper feelings than friendship). Since Rhaenyra and Alicent were on the verge of reconciling in episode 8, it makes sense that Rhaenyra doesn't immediately attack Otto. If there's a chance to mend that friendship and unite the realm, she will most definitely consider it.

Who is that dragon Daemon sings to, and what does that scene mean for Season 2?

While Rhaenyra exercises restraint after learning of her father's death, Daemon craves decisive action. With his brother dead and his wife's throne usurped, he's clearly on the warpath. He even takes his anger out on Rhaenyra. One of the episode's darker scenes sees him choking her at the mention of the Song of Ice and Fire. To him, this is a reminder of Viserys' own inaction and obsession over dreams. But in his mind, the Targaryens didn't get where they did because of dreams. The source of their power has always been dragons. And Daemon plans to get more of them.

Later in the episode, Daemon journeys under the Dragonmont on Dragonstone, where he encounters a very large dragon and sings to it in High Valyrian. That dragon is Vermithor, and he hasn't had a rider since Jaehaerys, the king before Viserys.

As Daemon points out, there are several riderless dragons roaming Westeros, including Laenor's old dragon Seasmoke. If the Blacks can find dragonriders, they'll get more dragons, and their advantage over the Greens will grow. Vermithor doesn't attack Daemon, so step one in his plan seems to be a success. Season 2 will likely see Daemon seeking out a new crop of dragonriders and teaching them... how to train their dragons.

What happens at Storm's End in the House of the Dragon finale?

The outfit? Impeccable. The kinslaying? Inexcusable. Credit: Gary Moyes/HBO

House of the Dragon Season 1 ends with our first big dragon battle of the series. It's Aemond's (Ewan Mitchell) behemoth Vhagar against Lucerys' small but speedy Arrax. Naturally, Vhagar trounces Arrax and devours Lucerys, but how we get to that point is equally as important as the dragon-chomping itself.

Lucerys does not find a warm welcome at the House Baratheon seat of Storm's End. Aemond has already agreed to marry one of Borros' daughters in exchange for his support, so Borros feels he has nothing to gain by backing Rhaenyra. However, Aemond escalates the situation by demanding that Lucerys remove one of his eyes as retribution for taking out Aemond's eye so long ago. (Aemond reveals he's had a sapphire put into his eye socket, confirming that he is the most dramatic Targaryen to ever live.)

Lucerys obviously refuses, and what follows is a sky fight! Vhagar hunts Arrax through the clouds, and while Aemond appears to just be having some sadistic fun, Vhagar is out for blood. She takes out Arrax and Lucerys in one big bite, leaving Aemond to stare on in horror as he realizes how gravely this will impact the conflict between Rhaenyra and Aegon. I don't know what to tell you, Aemond — when you play with fire, you get burned.

Vhagar's actions remind us of the immortal words of Daenerys Targaryen: "A dragon is not a slave." These are immensely powerful creatures capable of great destruction, and they have minds and desires of their own. Until this point in the show, they haven't fought each other. Now, though, all bets are off. If the Greens' dragons take on the Blacks', all of Westeros will suffer.

And by the end of the episode, it's clear that's where things are headed. In the finale's last moments, Daemon informs Rhaenyra of Lucerys's fate. She stares down the camera, anger and resolve burning in her eyes. It's a tremendous final bit of acting from D'Arcy, and an omen for Season 2: The Black Queen is going to war. Now, the fire and blood will rain down in earnest.

New week, new day, new Wordle! But if your brain is still stuck in Sunday mode, we've got some clues and the solution to help you out, as we do every day.

If you just want today's word, you can jump straight to the end of this article for October 24's Wordle solution, for puzzle #492. If you'd rather work through it yourself, keep reading for some tips, tricks, and clues.

Where did Wordle come from?

Wordle was initially created by engineer Josh Wardle as a gift for his partner, though it quickly spread until it became an international phenomenon. Thousands of players across the globe tackle Wordle each day, with some fans even having created alternate versions of the daily word puzzle game. These include battle royale format Squabble, music identification game Heardle, and variations like Dordle and Quordle that make you guess multiple words at once.

The popularity of Wordle even reached such heights that the New York Times bought it earlier this year, while TikTok creators live-stream themselves playing it.

What's the best Wordle starting word?

The goal of Wordle is to have fun, and there's no right way to have fun. Just choose whatever starting word feels right to you, and don't let anyone shame you for it. However, if you want to take a more strategic approach, we have a few ideas to help you pick a word that will spark joy. One tip is to select a word that includes at least two different vowels, plus some common consonants like S, T, R, or N.

What happened to the Wordle archive?

The entire archive of past Wordles used to be available for anyone to play in glorious days gone by. Unfortunately it has since been taken down, with the website's creator stating it was done at the request of the New York Times.

Is Wordle getting harder?

If you're finding Wordle too easy, you can try enabling its Hard Mode to give your brain a tougher challenge. But Wordle isn't getting any harder by itself — it's the same difficulty that it's always been.

Why are there two different Wordle answers some days?

Wordle is a fun, collective experience specifically because everyone's solving for the same word every day. Occasionally, though, Wordle has accepted two different solutions as correct on the same day. This is because the New York Times made changes to the Wordle word list after acquiring it, and sometimes swaps out words from the original list. To ensure you're getting the right answer every day, refresh your browser before you play — the site will save your streak.

Here's a subtle hint for today's Wordle answer:

You don't want it to be yours.

Does today's Wordle answer have a double letter?

Not today!

Today's Wordle is a 5-letter word that ends with...

The letter... T.

The Game of Thrones prequel series House of the Dragon is finally here, bringing George R.R. Martin's massive fantasy tome Fire & Blood to the small screen.

Fire & Blood tells the history of House Targaryen as they ruled over Westeros, including events like Aegon's initial conquest and the civil war knowns as the Dance of the Dragons. House of the Dragon focuses on the Dance and the events leading up to it, including the rivalry between Princess Rhaenyra Targaryen and Queen Alicent Hightower. However, just like with the TV adaptation of Game of Thrones, House of the Dragon makes several changes from the source material in order to make the transition from page to screen. Don't worry, book loyalists: Change can be a good thing, and in House of the Dragon's case, a grand majority of the adaptation choices work to enhance the narrative instead of detract from it.

From structural differences to missing characters and more, here are the biggest changes House of the Dragon has made so far.

A history book vs. a TV show

Starting out, the biggest difference between Fire & Blood and House of the Dragon is each work's individual structure. Fire & Blood is written as a history book by the fictional Archmaester Gyldayn, whereas House of the Dragon is a narrative TV show that adapts only a small portion of the centuries-long history covered in Fire & Blood.

Throughout Fire & Blood, Gyldayn discusses his differing sources for his work, especially during the section dealing with the Dance of the Dragons. These sources include conflicting reports from Maesters and Septons, as well as a court jester named Mushroom. Each source gives us a slightly different take on key moments that take place behind closed doors, Rashomon-style, with Mushroom's accounts tending to be the most lascivious and extreme. While characters like Mushroom do not figure into House of the Dragon, it will be fascinating to see which course of events House of the Dragon chooses to portray, as it will have to take a definitive stance on some of Fire & Blood's more ambiguous moments.

An exciting element that comes with adapting a history book (albeit a fictional one) is the chance to play around within the historical framework. Fire & Blood rarely delves into scene-level detail, which means House of the Dragon gets to add new scenes or embellish events that are already in the book. So while book readers may know the general story arc of House of the Dragon, they won't be able to anticipate some of the more granular, character-focused scenes. It's a good way to keep viewers on their toes, and to keep this adaptation somewhat unpredictable.

A tournament and a birth

The first episode of House of the Dragon is built around two key events: the birth of King Viserys and Queen Aemma's son, and the tournament to celebrate it. Scenes of fighting, like the brawl between Prince Daemon and Ser Criston Cole, are juxtaposed directly with Queen Aemma's painful labor, hammering home her earlier point to her daughter Rhaenyra that childbirth is a woman's battlefield. While Aemma's labor and the tourney introducing Criston do not happen at the same time in the books, the choice to bring them together is a smart one. We get the thematic parallels mentioned previously, as well as a good, old-fashioned Game of Thrones-style tournament. The lavish celebration also signals just how important a male heir is to the realm: If Aemma has a son, peace will likely continue. If not, questions about the line of succession will fester.

Aemma's death during childbirth isn't detailed in great amounts in Fire & Blood. However, Viserys's dilemma about whether to kill Aemma in order to make sure his son is born actually happens to other characters in the book. Much earlier in the Targaryen dynasty, Queen Alyssa Velaryon, mother to King Jaehaerys, experiences a similarly painful birth. The maester tending to her tells her husband, Lord Rogar Baratheon, that there's still a chance they can keep the child, but Alyssa is sure to die; Rogar chooses to save the child. The fact that House of the Dragon is drawing from events like this throughout Fire & Blood to enrich its narrative is fascinating, and proof of the flexibility the show has given its source material's historiographical nature.

Childhood friends: Rhaenyra and Alicent

House of the Dragon makes the excellent decision to center Rhaenyra and Alicent's friendship right from the start. The rift between them is what brings about the Dance of the Dragons, so it makes sense that House of the Dragon begins developing their relationship in the very first episode.

In Fire & Blood, Rhaenyra and Alicent aren't particularly close before Alicent marries King Viserys, but in House of the Dragon, they are fast friends. Their in-show childhood bond promises to make their fallout even more heartbreaking, which is sure to give later episodes even greater emotional weight.

A song of ice and what now?

During the first episode's final moments, King Viserys drops a truth bomb on Rhaenyra. Their ancestor, Aegon the Conqueror, conquered Westeros not just because of ambition, but because he had a dream. That dream foretold the end of mankind, brought on by a terrible winter — White Walkers, anyone?

There's nothing in Fire & Blood that suggests Aegon had this dream, but given that the book rarely delves into its characters' thoughts, there's nothing saying that Aegon didn't have this dream either. Perhaps this was Martin's intent all along. However, I'm not a fan of this particular storytelling tweak. It's way too neat a connection to Game of Thrones, and after the adverse fan reactions to Season 8, House of the Dragon needs as much of a fresh start as it can get. Plus, the reveal of Aegon's dream — which he called A Song of Ice and Fire, eliciting a massive eye roll from me — shifts focus away from the politics of House of the Dragons in favor of reminding us of a Big Bad we already know is coming. Heck, we already know that the Night King fails to conquer Westeros, so why bother tying it back to Aegon? In a series that has so far made many smart adaptation decisions, this is the only one I outright disagree with. We don't need "winter is coming," round two — House of the Dragon already has plenty of great characters and plot points to choose from.

The showdown at Dragonstone

The second episode of House of the Dragon, "The Rogue Prince," gives us a tease of what full Targaryen-on-Targaryen violence might look like. When Prince Daemon steals a dragon egg with the intent of giving it to his child with paramour Mysaria, King Viserys won't let that stand. He sends his Hand, Lord Otto Hightower, to Dragonstone to retrieve the egg.

However, it'll take more than a mere Hightower to change Daemon's mind. Just when violence between Daemon's gold cloaks and Otto's soldiers threatens to break out, Rhaenyra arrives on Dragonstone with her dragon, Syrax. She faces off with Daemon, goading him to kill her if he truly wants to be the heir. He relents and returns the egg, and the meeting concludes without bloodshed. Rhaenyra returns triumphantly to King's Landing, only to face the ire of Viserys for her disobedience.

While the egg saga takes up a sizable chunk of "The Rogue Prince," Martin details it in just a few sentences in Fire & Blood:

When he learned that his concubine was pregnant, Prince Daemon presented her with a dragon's egg and woke his brother's wroth. King Viserys commanded him to return the egg, send his whore away, and return to his lawful wife, or else be attainted as a traitor. The prince obeyed, though with ill grace...

When you compare this passage with House of the Dragon's version, you really see the show's adaptation process. Take a key incident from the book and make it the focal point of an episode, all while looping in more of your central characters, such as Rhaenyra.

The show's framing of the Dragonstone showdown places Rhaenyra in opposition with both her father and her uncle. This helps us understand just how much she has to offer, as well as how much she, as a woman in this male-dominated world, has to fight in order to be viewed as a viable heir.

Plus, we get to see Caraxes and Syrax in full force, and it never hurts to see more dragons.

Alicent and Viserys

Like in Fire & Blood, King Viserys chooses to marry Alicent Hightower in House of the Dragon. In the book, Alicent is described as having been the former king Jaehaerys's companion before he died, but we don't hear much more about her between then and the marriage announcement. However, more disreputable sources (looking at you, Mushroom!) claim she had sexual relationships with Daemon and Jaehaerys, and even with Viserys while he was still married to Queen Aemma. Luckily, the show does not take this route.

In the TV series, Alicent is pressured to gain Viserys's affection by her own father, the sneaky Otto Hightower. She's clearly uncomfortable with this, but obeys, acting as a companion to Viserys in a similar way to how she accompanies Jaehaerys in Fire & Blood. Her interactions with the king are early proof of her cunning and manipulation. Plus, they continue to set up the coming rift between her and Rhaenyra.

House of the Dragon goes hunting

Episode 3 of House of the Dragon, "Second of His Name," takes us on a hunting trip that is extremely tense for everyone involved. The hunt is a lavish affair: a celebration of Viserys and Alicent's son Aegon's second nameday. Of course, the arrival of a new male heir sparks questions about Rhaenyra's future, so she's understandably on edge. As the festivities get underway, she rejects advances from men like Jason Lannister, bonds with her sworn protector Ser Criston Cole, and gets all stabby-stabby with a boar. An all-around productive weekend for Rhaenyra.

And wouldn't you know it, none of this is in Fire & Blood! The novel does make mention of festivities held in the name of Alicent's children, but it never dives into them on a scene level. The same goes for Jason Lannister's attempted marriage proposal: One sentence reveals that he and his twin brother Tyland tried to win her over during a visit to Casterly Rock.

The addition of this hunt is a great way to delve into these events and bring the building tensions between characters to the forefront. This plot highlights Rhaenyra's worries about her title, Alicent's attempts to appease her best friend-turned-stepdaughter, Viserys's indecision about damn near everything, and so much more. While this hunt never explicitly happens in Fire & Blood, it would absolutely fit right in on the page.

Fighting the Crabfeeder

You've fed your last crab, sir! Credit: Ollie Upton / HBO

Besides the hunt, the other main thread of "Second of His Name" involves Corlys Velaryon and Daemon's fight against the villainous Crabfeeder. Their quest to take back the Stepstones results in House of the Dragon's first real battle, including Prince Daemon's mad sprint to glory and Corlys's son Laenor swooping in on his dragon Seasmoke.

As epic as this battle is, Daemon and Corlys's campaign in the Stepstones is most glossed over in Fire & Blood. Presumably, Archmaester Gyldayn cares more about the intrigue at court. He writes:

It is not our purpose here to recount the details of the private war Daemon Targaryen and Corlys Velaryon waged on the Stepstones. Suffice it to say that the fighting began in 106 AC... In 108 AC, when at last [Daemon] came face-to-face with Craghas Crabfeeder, her slew him single-handed and cut off his head with Dark Sister.

So far, House of the Dragon's best adaptation choices come from the fact that it knows when to take moments that Fire & Blood simply summarizes and tease them out into full-blown set pieces. The Stepstones battle sets a high bar for the show's action sequences and gives Laenor a worthy introduction. Remember him — he'll be important later.

Let's talk about sex, baby

Well, it happened. In episode 4 of House of the Dragon, "King of the Narrow Sea," the Targaryen incest hits in full force. Daemon brings his niece Rhaenyra on an excursion through King's Landing, and the two hook up at a brothel. Family bonding, the Westeros way! When Daemon leaves abruptly, Rhaenyra takes her desires into her own hands and has sex with Ser Criston, who is thankfully not related to her. However, he is also a member of the Kingsguard and took a vow of celibacy, so the whole situation is quite messy, to say the least.

This episode marks a large turning point for Rhaenyra and her relationships with Daemon, Criston, and Viserys. However, Rhaenyra's first sexual experiences and their consequences are somewhat ambiguous in Fire & Blood. Once again, we have different accounts from sources like Septon Eustace and Mushroom. According to Eustace, Daemon seduced Rhaenyra, and when the two were caught together, Rhaenyra begged Viserys to let her marry her uncle. On the other hand, Mushroom claims that Daemon had been teaching Rhaenyra about sex so she would be able to seduce Criston. These lessons included dressing as a page boy and visiting brothels, which we see occur in House of the Dragon. Despite the ambiguity in Fire & Blood, House of the Dragon makes a firm decision here and fully chooses Mushroom's account (minus some of the bluest details).

However, the same cannot be said when it comes to Rhaenyra's romance with Criston. Eustace states that Criston confessed his love for Rhaenyra and begged her to run away with him, but she refused. In Mushroom's much more bawdy account, Rhaenyra declared her love to Criston after she learned she was to be wed to Laenor. This version of the story sees Criston refuse Rhaenyra due to his vows as a member of the Kingsguard. House of the Dragon chooses neither account and instead charts its own path, with Rhaenyra successfully seducing Criston. This appears to mark the start of a secret relationship between the two, something that does not happen in Fire & Blood but which will surely have massive consequences going forward.

Farewell to Otto

Nothing worse than a Hand-King breakup. Credit: Ollie Upton / HBO

Viserys gets wise of Otto's cunning and ambition in episode 4 — only after Rhaenyra points it out. She's trying to deflect suspicion from her tryst with Daemon, but Viserys hears some truth in her words and dismisses Otto from the position of Hand.

In Fire & Blood, Viserys gets rid of Otto after he keeps pushing for Alicent's son to be named heir. This happens way before Rhaenyra's scandal, meaning that House of the Dragon is bringing several different threads together here. It's a strong choice: Now, Rhaenyra has far more of a hand in Otto's dismissal, continuing to create tension between her and Alicent.

Not only that, but this episode also forces Viserys to choose between believing his brother, his daughter, and his most trusted advisor. By the end of the episode, we can see he's believed elements of all three's stories. From Daemon and Otto's accounts, he thinks Daemon and Rhaenyra had sex, hence the contraceptive tea he has delivered to Rhaenyra at the end of the episode. But he also believes Rhaenyra's statement that Otto is a social climbing vulture. After spending so many episodes making bad decisions, finally Viserys makes some big — and fascinating — moves. And none of it would have been possible if House of the Dragon hadn't made this adaptation change.

Another bloody wedding

"We Light the Way," House of the Dragon's fifth episode, gives us a classic Game of Thrones staple: a wedding. It also gives us another Game of Thrones staple: death at said wedding.

The victim at Rhaenyra and Laenor's wedding is none other than Ser Joffrey — no, not that Joffrey. This is Joffrey Lonmouth, Laenor's lover. He taunts Criston about the marriage of their lovers to each other, and Criston, still reeling from Rhaenyra's rejection of his plan to run away and get married in Essos, decides that it's clobbering time.

Criston does kill Joffrey in Fire & Blood, but he does at the wedding tourney instead of the feast. House of the Dragon has already given us an intense tournament sequence in its first episode, so the choice to move the fight makes sense. The show also expands on why Criston would want to kill Joffrey. In the book, it's just said that Joffrey "felt the fullest measure of [Criston's] wroth" — the level of violence at the tourney is strange, but since this is a historical account, we don't dive into the reasoning behind it as much. In House of the Dragon, with Criston and Joffrey's interaction at the wedding, we understand what led Criston to snap so completely.

Alicent takes center stage

And the award for best entrance goes to... Credit: Ollie Upton / HBO

Rhaenyra and Laenor may have gotten married, but their wedding — and their whole wedding episode — is all about Alicent. In Fire & Blood, Alicent is villainous, self-serving, and the all-around worst. House of the Dragon delves deeper into her motivations in order to make her more of a compelling human being. She's been used as a pawn by her father and lost her best friend as a result. Plus, since Alicent's children present a threat to Rhaenyra's succession, she also has to deal with the worry that Rhaenyra will try to have them killed. "We Light the Way" does a great job of laying this out, and of showing how Alicent plans to move forward. For example, Alicent's green dress, mentioned in passing in Fire & Blood, gets a much bigger moment in House of the Dragon. This is her first major stand against Viserys: a retaliation for him sending her father away and for learning about Rhaenyra's lie.

"We Light the Way" also clarifies how Alicent and Criston come to be such fierce allies. In Fire & Blood, Criston becomes Alicent's sworn protector after the tourney where he kills Joffrey. We don't learn much more than that, but House of the Dragon fills in the gaps: heartbroken at Rhaenyra's impending marriage, Criston tells Alicent about his relationship with her. Later, after killing Joffrey, he prepares to die by suicide. However, Alicent stops him, and the two join forces. This choice is yet another smart move in a string of strong adaptation choices, continuing House of the Dragon's trend of fleshing out Fire & Blood's most important historical points. Plus, we're able to watch Alicent assemble her allies after episodes of seeing her get used by those around her. Her actions here will have major consequences going forward, and they cement her as one of House of the Dragon's most important players.

Larys started the fire

Who, me? Credit: Ollie Upton / HBO

House of the Dragon undergoes a 10-year time jump between episodes 5 and 6. During this time, both Rhaenyra and Alicent have more children. However, Rhaenyra's children's parentage is called into question because none of them bear a resemblance to Laenor. They don't even have the trademark Targaryen and Velaryon silver hair! Instead, they all look suspiciously like Rhaenyra's sworn protector and head of the City Watch, Harwin Strong. When Criston Cole insinuates that Harwin is the boys' father, Harwin very publicly snaps and beats him up. Harwin's father Lyonel, now Hand of the King, realizes the implications of the act and attempts to resign to preserve his house's reputation somewhat — a detail that isn't in Fire & Blood but that helps flesh out the Strongs' relationship to honor.

That takes us to one of episode 6's biggest death scenes: A fire breaks out at the Strong castle of Harrenhal, killing both Harwin and Lyonel. Who was responsible? Fire & Blood presents multiple theories as to who may have started the fire. Could it have been Daemon, trying to eliminate a romantic rival, or Viserys, hoping to salvage Rhaenyra's honor? Or maybe it was Corlys, seeking vengeance for Harwin's cuckolding of Laenor? (Rhaenyra and Laenor's arrangement that they get to see other people is new to the show, so the cuckolding is less of a point of tension.) The book also suggests Larys Strong, Harwin's younger brother, as a possible culprit, and that's the route the show takes.

In positioning Larys as the orchestrator of his family's deaths, House of the Dragon once again chooses a definitive path where Fire & Blood opted for historical ambiguity. This choice sets Larys up as a major player in the coming episodes. With his father and brother dead, he becomes Lord of Harrenhal. He also cements himself as a part of Queen Alicent's inner circle — although from the looks of it, she may regret bringing such a ruthless man so close to her.

Death by "Dracarys!"

RIP, Laena. Credit: Ollie Upton / HBO

Harwin and Lyonel are not the only House of the Dragon characters to die by fire in episode 6. They're joined in fiery death by Laena Velaryon, a dragonrider and Daemon's second wife. In Fire & Blood, Laena dies after a horrifying childbirth. She attempts to ride her dragon Vhagar one last time before she dies, only to collapse and perish before she can get to her. House of the Dragon takes things in a more dramatic direction, to say the least. In House of the Dragon, a pain-stricken Laena reaches Vhagar, but instead of trying to take flight, she utters that immortal phrase: "Dracarys!" After some initial hesitation, Vhagar sets Laena on fire.

When it comes to House of the Dragon deaths, self-immolation by dragonfire has to be the most metal way to go. Yet the scene is undeniably tragic. Laena's passing plays like a companion to Aemma's remarkably cruel death in episode 1. Both women suffer from immense pain during labor, and both their husbands are offered the choice of killing the mother to save the child. While Aemma is subjected to this horror, Laena flees and, in a last grasp at agency, chooses to die as close to a dragonrider's death as she can.

Fighting at a funeral

Episode 7 of House of the Dragon takes us to Driftmark for Laena's funeral, where Prince Aemond Targaryen tames and rides Laena's old dragon, Vhagar. When he lands, Rhaenyra's children, as well as Laena's daughters Baela and Rhaena, attack him in anger. In the ensuing brawl, Lucerys Velaryon takes out one of Aemond's eyes. In Fire & Blood, this sequence actually happens at Laenor's funeral (more on that later), and Baela and Rhaena aren't involved. However, in moving the Aemond fight and emphasizing Baela and Rhaena's grief, House of the Dragon is able to ground the scene even deeper in emotion, as well as highlight why the children are so upset. Laena only just died and Aemond is already stealing her dragon? Heck, I'm angry too!

In the aftermath of the children's fight, Alicent demands that Lucerys lose an eye just as Aemond did. She also makes this demand in the book. What she doesn't do in Fire & Blood, but does in the show, is steal Viserys's dagger and try to take Rhaenyra's eye out herself. Alicent's full-on attack perfectly sets up the coming Dance of the Dragons, and it gives us a welcome chance to watch her snap. Throughout the show, Alicent has been composed and calculated, always doing what's asked of her while she sees Rhaenyra flouting her marriage entirely. Here, her frustration and rage get the best of her in an explosive scene that's one of the show's best so far. Olivia Cooke's delivery of "Where is duty? Where is sacrifice?" will go down in House of the Dragon history, along with Emma d'Arcy's whispered, "Now they see you as you are."

Laenor lives!

Congratulations on surviving! Credit: Ollie Upton / HBO

For what might be the first time ever, a Game of Thrones show lets one of the characters that died in its source material walk away unscathed. Laenor, who perishes in a fight with his paramour Ser Qarl in Fire & Blood, doesn't die in House of the Dragon! Instead, he and Qarl fake his death and flee Driftmark to travel across the Narrow Sea. There, they can be open about their love for one another.

How did Laenor and Qarl's escape come about? Well, Rhaenyra and Daemon decide to marry to shore up their power. (Hear that? That's the sound of the Targaryen incest alarms.) However, to get hitched, they need to get Laenor out of the way. Daemon dons the murder cloak he wore to kill his wife and bribes Qarl for a quick death. But he never specifies whose death! Qarl stages Laenor's murder, making it look like he burned in the hearth at Driftmark. As Corlys and Rhaenys mourn their son and Rhaenyra marries Daemon, Qarl and a very much alive Laenor head out to sea.

This is easily the biggest change Fire & Blood makes from its source material, especially given George R.R. Martin's penchant for killing his characters. However, it's unclear whether Laenor's survival will impact the plot moving forward. Everyone thinks he's dead, and why would he and Qarl return to Westeros when they can be happy elsewhere? As sides in the Dance of the Dragons solidify, there's one thing we can be sure of: Somewhere in Essos, Laenor and Qarl are living happy, lavish lives thanks to Daemon's bribe money. It's as close to a fairy-tale ending as Game of Thrones can get.

The petition for Driftmark

"Lord of the Tides," episode 8 of House of the Dragon, revolves around various characters' petitions to become Lord of Driftmark should Corlys pass away. Contenders include Rhaenyra's son and the named heir Lucerys, whose claim has been questioned due to his parentage; Rhaenys, Corlys's wife; and Vaemond Velaryon, Corlys's younger brother in the show (and nephew in Fire & Blood). While the question of succession is addressed in the book, the petitions are new additions for the show: another example of House of the Dragon expanding on briefly mentioned crises in Martin's work.

Also new is Vaemond's death, which deserves a special shout-out here. Vaemond does die in the book after accusing Lucerys of being a bastard. Rhaenyra sends Daemon to kill him and then feeds his corpse to her dragon, Syrax. However in the show, Daemon straight-up chops through his head in the middle of the Red Keep's throne room. It's a major power move and a classic out-of-nowhere Game of Thrones-style death. Sliced and diced.

RIP Viserys

Good night, sweet prince. Er, king. Credit: Ollie Upton / HBO

King Viserys finally shuffles off the mortal coil in this episode. We all saw it coming; he's been marked for blood since day one. However, we never anticipated just how that death would play out in House of the Dragon. In Fire & Blood, Viserys grows old and dies in his sleep. In House of the Dragon, the man goes full Crypt Keeper. He's rotting off his own bones, he's losing body parts left and right... He's just going through it. Finally, at the end of "Lord of the Tides," he passes away. And just after a relatively happy family dinner, no less!

But this being House of the Dragon, we won't know peace yet. That's because right before he dies, Viserys mentions the Song of Ice and Fire prophecy to Alicent, believing her to be Rhaenyra. After hearing a few mumbled words about Aegon (the Conqueror, not Alicent's son, although she has no way of knowing it) and uniting the kingdom, Alicent believes Viserys wants his son to take the throne instead of Rhaenyra. No, Viserys, why couldn't you just keep your mouth shut? The future was looking somewhat bright, at least by Westerosi standards, but your last words may have divided the Seven Kingdoms forever. Bring on the Dance of the Dragons.

We're crowning Aegon! We just have to find him first.

Episode 9 of House of the Dragon, titled "The Green Council," picks up right where episode 8 left off: with Viserys dying and Alicent interpreting his last words as him choosing Aegon as his successor. As soon as Otto gets word of this, he springs into action, gathering the Small Council to organize Aegon's coronation. The only problem? Aegon is nowhere to be found. So sets in motion a hunt for the king-to-be, a hunt that surprisingly pits Alicent against Otto. The Hand wants to kill Rhaenyra and her family as soon as possible, but Alicent has doubts about that, especially following their slight reconciliation last episode.

Much of the search for Aegon is new to the show, as is the tension between Otto and Alicent. In the book, they are a united front as they work to rouse and crown Aegon. Here, Otto is the heartless monster who sets things in motion, while Alicent comes off as much more sympathetic thanks to her worry for Rhaenyra.

House of the Dragon also greatly speeds up the time between Viserys's dying and Aegon's coronation. In the book, it takes about 10 days to finalize the choice to crown Aegon, during which the smell of Viserys's corpse stinks up the Red Keep. Here, Otto and Alicent move fast, plus the show adds a bunch of new material, like Aemond and Criston's discussions, Larys and Alicent's "arrangement," and Mysaria's involvement. (The street urchin fighting rings are very much in Fire & Blood.) The entire expanded search for Aegon emphasizes just how much of a pawn he is in the schemes of older characters. Plus, in seeing all his common haunts (again, the child fights!) we realize just how unfit he is to be king. Pair that with the fact that neither of his parents truly love him and the extreme ego boost he gets from the crowd's cheering at his coronation, and you're looking at a recipe for a megalomaniac disaster.

Rhaenys crashes a coronation

Rhaenys takes matters into her own hands — and it's amazing. Credit: Ollie Upton / HBO

The absolute coolest moment of "The Green Council" is nowhere to be seen in Fire & Blood. The Hightowers lock Rhaenys in the Red Keep and try to win her (and her dragon Meleys) over to their side. However, Ser Erryk Cargyll, a knight of the Kingsguard who decides to back Rhaenyra's claim over Aegon's, helps her escape. She winds up in the dragon pit for the coronation and sneaks away to grab her dragon and get the heck out of dodge.

What follows is a moment of absolute and total badassery. Rhaenys and Meleys crash through the floor of the dragon pit, interrupting a coronation that had otherwise been going pretty well. Meleys turns on Alicent and Aegon, but Rhaenys does not issue the kill order. Perhaps she is trying to limit bloodshed, or she finds Alicent's protection of Aegon moving enough to spare her. Whatever the reason, Rhaenys certainly makes a big splash at the coronation before taking her Valyrian exit (which is what I call flying out of large gatherings on dragonback).

The showdown at Storm's End

The centerpiece of the Season 1 finale of House of the Dragon is undoubtedly the standoff between Lucerys Velaryon and Aemond Targaryen at Storm's End, the seat of House Baratheon. Both have come to secure Lord Borros Baratheon's support: Lucerys for his mother Rhaenyra, and Aemond for his brother Aegon. Borros sides with Aemond, and to make everything worse, Aemond demands that Lucerys take out an eye in exchange for taking his years ago. After Lucerys refuses, the two take to the skies on their dragons for a tense chase, which culminates in Aemond losing control of Vhagar, and Vhagar eating Lucerys.

The broad strokes of the Storm's End sequence play out pretty faithfully to Fire & Blood, but there are still some differences. In the book, Aemond is about to let Lucerys go before one of Borros's daughters goads him into going after him. Here, House of the Dragon streamlines the process: Aemond hasn't quite finished having fun with his nephew yet, so he follows him on his dragon Vhagar. It reads more like a schoolyard tyrant kicking a victim when he's down than someone hellbent on killing.

That difference in intent — scaring as opposed to outright killing — marks the finale's biggest change from Fire & Blood. Here, Lucerys' death is a result of Aemond's failure to keep Vhagar in line, not a direct command from Aemond himself. The fight between Vhagar and Lucerys's dragon Arrax isn't too detailed in the book, so it's possible a similar accident occurred but was not recorded in history. However, the aftermath of the fight, including Aemond returning to King's Landing expecting a hero's welcome, suggests that his kinslaying actions were all too intentional. In House of the Dragon, the kinslaying is a preventable tragedy, as well as a reminder of just how powerful dragons are. Sometimes, age-old creatures of immense power will rebel against their riders — who could have guessed?

What's next for House of the Dragon?

So you're queen — now what? Credit: Ollie Upton/HBO

One word: war! With Aegon's ascension and Lucerys' death, the Dance of the Dragons is officially in full swing. And based on the look in Rhaenyra's eyes at the very end of the finale, the Blacks are going to retaliate against the Greens in a big way.

Season 2 will likely open with Jacaerys's arrival in Winterfell to gain the support of the North, but plenty of chaos will still be raging in the South as the struggle for power continues. We'll see one of Westerosi history's most brutal moments yet (no spoilers, but look up Blood and Cheese if you're curious). Daemon's interaction with the dragon Vermithor in the finale also suggests that he's going to attempt to find new dragonriders to help boost Rhaenyra's number, so get excited for more dragon battles.

Finally, since House of the Dragon has focused so much energy on fleshing out the relationship between Rhaenyra and Alicent, the evolution of their dynamic in the war to come will surely play a large role as well. Although after everything that's happened, I doubt we'll be seeing them reconcile any time soon.

Final verdict

House of the Dragon takes on the daunting task of adapting a "historical account" full of ambiguity, and creates a haunting portrait of a family torn apart by power. The expansion and centering of the friendship between Rhaenyra and Alicent works wonders and provides both characters — but especially Alicent — a much-needed humanity that we don't always get from Fire & Blood's historical retelling. House of the Dragon is also able to expand on some key Fire & Blood moments in new and exciting ways, giving us new scenes like Rhaenyra and Daemon's face-off on Dragonstone in episode 2 and the entirety of Rhaenyra and Laenor's very chaotic wedding.

Not every change works. The focus on Aegon the Conqueror's prophecy reeks of an attempt to connect to the plot of Game of Thrones, and the time jumps can get a little confusing. Plus, all the hopping around in time leads us to miss some moments that would have been great to see on screen. Who wouldn't have wanted to watch Laena tame Vhagar, or see the beginnings of Rhaenyra and Harwin Strong's courtship?

Overall, though, House of the Dragon knocks it out of the park as an adaptation, taking the weighty history of Martin's work and making sure to flesh out all the small character moments over ten episodes. House of the Dragon has already been renewed for a Season 2, so we can hopefully expect more excellent adaptation choices — and dragons — in the near future.
The Game of Thrones prequel series House of the Dragon is finally here, bringing George R.R. Martin's massive fantasy tome Fire & Blood to the small screen.

Fire & Blood tells the history of House Targaryen as they ruled over Westeros, including events like Aegon's initial conquest and the civil war knowns as the Dance of the Dragons. House of the Dragon focuses on the Dance and the events leading up to it, including the rivalry between Princess Rhaenyra Targaryen and Queen Alicent Hightower. However, just like with the TV adaptation of Game of Thrones, House of the Dragon makes several changes from the source material in order to make the transition from page to screen. Don't worry, book loyalists: Change can be a good thing, and in House of the Dragon's case, a grand majority of the adaptation choices work to enhance the narrative instead of detract from it.

From structural differences to missing characters and more, here are the biggest changes House of the Dragon has made so far.

A history book vs. a TV show

Starting out, the biggest difference between Fire & Blood and House of the Dragon is each work's individual structure. Fire & Blood is written as a history book by the fictional Archmaester Gyldayn, whereas House of the Dragon is a narrative TV show that adapts only a small portion of the centuries-long history covered in Fire & Blood.

Throughout Fire & Blood, Gyldayn discusses his differing sources for his work, especially during the section dealing with the Dance of the Dragons. These sources include conflicting reports from Maesters and Septons, as well as a court jester named Mushroom. Each source gives us a slightly different take on key moments that take place behind closed doors, Rashomon-style, with Mushroom's accounts tending to be the most lascivious and extreme. While characters like Mushroom do not figure into House of the Dragon, it will be fascinating to see which course of events House of the Dragon chooses to portray, as it will have to take a definitive stance on some of Fire & Blood's more ambiguous moments.

An exciting element that comes with adapting a history book (albeit a fictional one) is the chance to play around within the historical framework. Fire & Blood rarely delves into scene-level detail, which means House of the Dragon gets to add new scenes or embellish events that are already in the book. So while book readers may know the general story arc of House of the Dragon, they won't be able to anticipate some of the more granular, character-focused scenes. It's a good way to keep viewers on their toes, and to keep this adaptation somewhat unpredictable.

A tournament and a birth

The first episode of House of the Dragon is built around two key events: the birth of King Viserys and Queen Aemma's son, and the tournament to celebrate it. Scenes of fighting, like the brawl between Prince Daemon and Ser Criston Cole, are juxtaposed directly with Queen Aemma's painful labor, hammering home her earlier point to her daughter Rhaenyra that childbirth is a woman's battlefield. While Aemma's labor and the tourney introducing Criston do not happen at the same time in the books, the choice to bring them together is a smart one. We get the thematic parallels mentioned previously, as well as a good, old-fashioned Game of Thrones-style tournament. The lavish celebration also signals just how important a male heir is to the realm: If Aemma has a son, peace will likely continue. If not, questions about the line of succession will fester.

Aemma's death during childbirth isn't detailed in great amounts in Fire & Blood. However, Viserys's dilemma about whether to kill Aemma in order to make sure his son is born actually happens to other characters in the book. Much earlier in the Targaryen dynasty, Queen Alyssa Velaryon, mother to King Jaehaerys, experiences a similarly painful birth. The maester tending to her tells her husband, Lord Rogar Baratheon, that there's still a chance they can keep the child, but Alyssa is sure to die; Rogar chooses to save the child. The fact that House of the Dragon is drawing from events like this throughout Fire & Blood to enrich its narrative is fascinating, and proof of the flexibility the show has given its source material's historiographical nature.

Childhood friends: Rhaenyra and Alicent

House of the Dragon makes the excellent decision to center Rhaenyra and Alicent's friendship right from the start. The rift between them is what brings about the Dance of the Dragons, so it makes sense that House of the Dragon begins developing their relationship in the very first episode.

In Fire & Blood, Rhaenyra and Alicent aren't particularly close before Alicent marries King Viserys, but in House of the Dragon, they are fast friends. Their in-show childhood bond promises to make their fallout even more heartbreaking, which is sure to give later episodes even greater emotional weight.

A song of ice and what now?

During the first episode's final moments, King Viserys drops a truth bomb on Rhaenyra. Their ancestor, Aegon the Conqueror, conquered Westeros not just because of ambition, but because he had a dream. That dream foretold the end of mankind, brought on by a terrible winter — White Walkers, anyone?

There's nothing in Fire & Blood that suggests Aegon had this dream, but given that the book rarely delves into its characters' thoughts, there's nothing saying that Aegon didn't have this dream either. Perhaps this was Martin's intent all along. However, I'm not a fan of this particular storytelling tweak. It's way too neat a connection to Game of Thrones, and after the adverse fan reactions to Season 8, House of the Dragon needs as much of a fresh start as it can get. Plus, the reveal of Aegon's dream — which he called A Song of Ice and Fire, eliciting a massive eye roll from me — shifts focus away from the politics of House of the Dragons in favor of reminding us of a Big Bad we already know is coming. Heck, we already know that the Night King fails to conquer Westeros, so why bother tying it back to Aegon? In a series that has so far made many smart adaptation decisions, this is the only one I outright disagree with. We don't need "winter is coming," round two — House of the Dragon already has plenty of great characters and plot points to choose from.

The showdown at Dragonstone

The second episode of House of the Dragon, "The Rogue Prince," gives us a tease of what full Targaryen-on-Targaryen violence might look like. When Prince Daemon steals a dragon egg with the intent of giving it to his child with paramour Mysaria, King Viserys won't let that stand. He sends his Hand, Lord Otto Hightower, to Dragonstone to retrieve the egg.

However, it'll take more than a mere Hightower to change Daemon's mind. Just when violence between Daemon's gold cloaks and Otto's soldiers threatens to break out, Rhaenyra arrives on Dragonstone with her dragon, Syrax. She faces off with Daemon, goading him to kill her if he truly wants to be the heir. He relents and returns the egg, and the meeting concludes without bloodshed. Rhaenyra returns triumphantly to King's Landing, only to face the ire of Viserys for her disobedience.

While the egg saga takes up a sizable chunk of "The Rogue Prince," Martin details it in just a few sentences in Fire & Blood:

When he learned that his concubine was pregnant, Prince Daemon presented her with a dragon's egg and woke his brother's wroth. King Viserys commanded him to return the egg, send his whore away, and return to his lawful wife, or else be attainted as a traitor. The prince obeyed, though with ill grace...

When you compare this passage with House of the Dragon's version, you really see the show's adaptation process. Take a key incident from the book and make it the focal point of an episode, all while looping in more of your central characters, such as Rhaenyra.

The show's framing of the Dragonstone showdown places Rhaenyra in opposition with both her father and her uncle. This helps us understand just how much she has to offer, as well as how much she, as a woman in this male-dominated world, has to fight in order to be viewed as a viable heir.

Plus, we get to see Caraxes and Syrax in full force, and it never hurts to see more dragons.

Alicent and Viserys

Alicent is on an uncomfortable mission. Credit: Ollie Upton / HBO

Like in Fire & Blood, King Viserys chooses to marry Alicent Hightower in House of the Dragon. In the book, Alicent is described as having been the former king Jaehaerys's companion before he died, but we don't hear much more about her between then and the marriage announcement. However, more disreputable sources (looking at you, Mushroom!) claim she had sexual relationships with Daemon and Jaehaerys, and even with Viserys while he was still married to Queen Aemma. Luckily, the show does not take this route.

In the TV series, Alicent is pressured to gain Viserys's affection by her own father, the sneaky Otto Hightower. She's clearly uncomfortable with this, but obeys, acting as a companion to Viserys in a similar way to how she accompanies Jaehaerys in Fire & Blood. Her interactions with the king are early proof of her cunning and manipulation. Plus, they continue to set up the coming rift between her and Rhaenyra.

House of the Dragon goes hunting

Episode 3 of House of the Dragon, "Second of His Name," takes us on a hunting trip that is extremely tense for everyone involved. The hunt is a lavish affair: a celebration of Viserys and Alicent's son Aegon's second nameday. Of course, the arrival of a new male heir sparks questions about Rhaenyra's future, so she's understandably on edge. As the festivities get underway, she rejects advances from men like Jason Lannister, bonds with her sworn protector Ser Criston Cole, and gets all stabby-stabby with a boar. An all-around productive weekend for Rhaenyra.

And wouldn't you know it, none of this is in Fire & Blood! The novel does make mention of festivities held in the name of Alicent's children, but it never dives into them on a scene level. The same goes for Jason Lannister's attempted marriage proposal: One sentence reveals that he and his twin brother Tyland tried to win her over during a visit to Casterly Rock.

The addition of this hunt is a great way to delve into these events and bring the building tensions between characters to the forefront. This plot highlights Rhaenyra's worries about her title, Alicent's attempts to appease her best friend-turned-stepdaughter, Viserys's indecision about damn near everything, and so much more. While this hunt never explicitly happens in Fire & Blood, it would absolutely fit right in on the page.

Fighting the Crabfeeder

You've fed your last crab, sir! Credit: Ollie Upton / HBO

Besides the hunt, the other main thread of "Second of His Name" involves Corlys Velaryon and Daemon's fight against the villainous Crabfeeder. Their quest to take back the Stepstones results in House of the Dragon's first real battle, including Prince Daemon's mad sprint to glory and Corlys's son Laenor swooping in on his dragon Seasmoke.

As epic as this battle is, Daemon and Corlys's campaign in the Stepstones is most glossed over in Fire & Blood. Presumably, Archmaester Gyldayn cares more about the intrigue at court. He writes:

It is not our purpose here to recount the details of the private war Daemon Targaryen and Corlys Velaryon waged on the Stepstones. Suffice it to say that the fighting began in 106 AC... In 108 AC, when at last [Daemon] came face-to-face with Craghas Crabfeeder, her slew him single-handed and cut off his head with Dark Sister.

So far, House of the Dragon's best adaptation choices come from the fact that it knows when to take moments that Fire & Blood simply summarizes and tease them out into full-blown set pieces. The Stepstones battle sets a high bar for the show's action sequences and gives Laenor a worthy introduction. Remember him — he'll be important later.

Let's talk about sex, baby

Well, it happened. In episode 4 of House of the Dragon, "King of the Narrow Sea," the Targaryen incest hits in full force. Daemon brings his niece Rhaenyra on an excursion through King's Landing, and the two hook up at a brothel. Family bonding, the Westeros way! When Daemon leaves abruptly, Rhaenyra takes her desires into her own hands and has sex with Ser Criston, who is thankfully not related to her. However, he is also a member of the Kingsguard and took a vow of celibacy, so the whole situation is quite messy, to say the least.

This episode marks a large turning point for Rhaenyra and her relationships with Daemon, Criston, and Viserys. However, Rhaenyra's first sexual experiences and their consequences are somewhat ambiguous in Fire & Blood. Once again, we have different accounts from sources like Septon Eustace and Mushroom. According to Eustace, Daemon seduced Rhaenyra, and when the two were caught together, Rhaenyra begged Viserys to let her marry her uncle. On the other hand, Mushroom claims that Daemon had been teaching Rhaenyra about sex so she would be able to seduce Criston. These lessons included dressing as a page boy and visiting brothels, which we see occur in House of the Dragon. Despite the ambiguity in Fire & Blood, House of the Dragon makes a firm decision here and fully chooses Mushroom's account (minus some of the bluest details).

However, the same cannot be said when it comes to Rhaenyra's romance with Criston. Eustace states that Criston confessed his love for Rhaenyra and begged her to run away with him, but she refused. In Mushroom's much more bawdy account, Rhaenyra declared her love to Criston after she learned she was to be wed to Laenor. This version of the story sees Criston refuse Rhaenyra due to his vows as a member of the Kingsguard. House of the Dragon chooses neither account and instead charts its own path, with Rhaenyra successfully seducing Criston. This appears to mark the start of a secret relationship between the two, something that does not happen in Fire & Blood but which will surely have massive consequences going forward.

Farewell to Otto

Nothing worse than a Hand-King breakup. Credit: Ollie Upton / HBO

Viserys gets wise of Otto's cunning and ambition in episode 4 — only after Rhaenyra points it out. She's trying to deflect suspicion from her tryst with Daemon, but Viserys hears some truth in her words and dismisses Otto from the position of Hand.

In Fire & Blood, Viserys gets rid of Otto after he keeps pushing for Alicent's son to be named heir. This happens way before Rhaenyra's scandal, meaning that House of the Dragon is bringing several different threads together here. It's a strong choice: Now, Rhaenyra has far more of a hand in Otto's dismissal, continuing to create tension between her and Alicent.

Not only that, but this episode also forces Viserys to choose between believing his brother, his daughter, and his most trusted advisor. By the end of the episode, we can see he's believed elements of all three's stories. From Daemon and Otto's accounts, he thinks Daemon and Rhaenyra had sex, hence the contraceptive tea he has delivered to Rhaenyra at the end of the episode. But he also believes Rhaenyra's statement that Otto is a social climbing vulture. After spending so many episodes making bad decisions, finally Viserys makes some big — and fascinating — moves. And none of it would have been possible if House of the Dragon hadn't made this adaptation change.

Another bloody wedding

"We Light the Way," House of the Dragon's fifth episode, gives us a classic Game of Thrones staple: a wedding. It also gives us another Game of Thrones staple: death at said wedding.

The victim at Rhaenyra and Laenor's wedding is none other than Ser Joffrey — no, not that Joffrey. This is Joffrey Lonmouth, Laenor's lover. He taunts Criston about the marriage of their lovers to each other, and Criston, still reeling from Rhaenyra's rejection of his plan to run away and get married in Essos, decides that it's clobbering time.

Criston does kill Joffrey in Fire & Blood, but he does at the wedding tourney instead of the feast. House of the Dragon has already given us an intense tournament sequence in its first episode, so the choice to move the fight makes sense. The show also expands on why Criston would want to kill Joffrey. In the book, it's just said that Joffrey "felt the fullest measure of [Criston's] wroth" — the level of violence at the tourney is strange, but since this is a historical account, we don't dive into the reasoning behind it as much. In House of the Dragon, with Criston and Joffrey's interaction at the wedding, we understand what led Criston to snap so completely.

Alicent takes center stage

And the award for best entrance goes to... Credit: Ollie Upton / HBO

Rhaenyra and Laenor may have gotten married, but their wedding — and their whole wedding episode — is all about Alicent. In Fire & Blood, Alicent is villainous, self-serving, and the all-around worst. House of the Dragon delves deeper into her motivations in order to make her more of a compelling human being. She's been used as a pawn by her father and lost her best friend as a result. Plus, since Alicent's children present a threat to Rhaenyra's succession, she also has to deal with the worry that Rhaenyra will try to have them killed. "We Light the Way" does a great job of laying this out, and of showing how Alicent plans to move forward. For example, Alicent's green dress, mentioned in passing in Fire & Blood, gets a much bigger moment in House of the Dragon. This is her first major stand against Viserys: a retaliation for him sending her father away and for learning about Rhaenyra's lie.

"We Light the Way" also clarifies how Alicent and Criston come to be such fierce allies. In Fire & Blood, Criston becomes Alicent's sworn protector after the tourney where he kills Joffrey. We don't learn much more than that, but House of the Dragon fills in the gaps: heartbroken at Rhaenyra's impending marriage, Criston tells Alicent about his relationship with her. Later, after killing Joffrey, he prepares to die by suicide. However, Alicent stops him, and the two join forces. This choice is yet another smart move in a string of strong adaptation choices, continuing House of the Dragon's trend of fleshing out Fire & Blood's most important historical points. Plus, we're able to watch Alicent assemble her allies after episodes of seeing her get used by those around her. Her actions here will have major consequences going forward, and they cement her as one of House of the Dragon's most important players.

Larys started the fire

Who, me? Credit: Ollie Upton / HBO

House of the Dragon undergoes a 10-year time jump between episodes 5 and 6. During this time, both Rhaenyra and Alicent have more children. However, Rhaenyra's children's parentage is called into question because none of them bear a resemblance to Laenor. They don't even have the trademark Targaryen and Velaryon silver hair! Instead, they all look suspiciously like Rhaenyra's sworn protector and head of the City Watch, Harwin Strong. When Criston Cole insinuates that Harwin is the boys' father, Harwin very publicly snaps and beats him up. Harwin's father Lyonel, now Hand of the King, realizes the implications of the act and attempts to resign to preserve his house's reputation somewhat — a detail that isn't in Fire & Blood but that helps flesh out the Strongs' relationship to honor.

That takes us to one of episode 6's biggest death scenes: A fire breaks out at the Strong castle of Harrenhal, killing both Harwin and Lyonel. Who was responsible? Fire & Blood presents multiple theories as to who may have started the fire. Could it have been Daemon, trying to eliminate a romantic rival, or Viserys, hoping to salvage Rhaenyra's honor? Or maybe it was Corlys, seeking vengeance for Harwin's cuckolding of Laenor? (Rhaenyra and Laenor's arrangement that they get to see other people is new to the show, so the cuckolding is less of a point of tension.) The book also suggests Larys Strong, Harwin's younger brother, as a possible culprit, and that's the route the show takes.

In positioning Larys as the orchestrator of his family's deaths, House of the Dragon once again chooses a definitive path where Fire & Blood opted for historical ambiguity. This choice sets Larys up as a major player in the coming episodes. With his father and brother dead, he becomes Lord of Harrenhal. He also cements himself as a part of Queen Alicent's inner circle — although from the looks of it, she may regret bringing such a ruthless man so close to her.

Death by "Dracarys!"

RIP, Laena. Credit: Ollie Upton / HBO

Harwin and Lyonel are not the only House of the Dragon characters to die by fire in episode 6. They're joined in fiery death by Laena Velaryon, a dragonrider and Daemon's second wife. In Fire & Blood, Laena dies after a horrifying childbirth. She attempts to ride her dragon Vhagar one last time before she dies, only to collapse and perish before she can get to her. House of the Dragon takes things in a more dramatic direction, to say the least. In House of the Dragon, a pain-stricken Laena reaches Vhagar, but instead of trying to take flight, she utters that immortal phrase: "Dracarys!" After some initial hesitation, Vhagar sets Laena on fire.

When it comes to House of the Dragon deaths, self-immolation by dragonfire has to be the most metal way to go. Yet the scene is undeniably tragic. Laena's passing plays like a companion to Aemma's remarkably cruel death in episode 1. Both women suffer from immense pain during labor, and both their husbands are offered the choice of killing the mother to save the child. While Aemma is subjected to this horror, Laena flees and, in a last grasp at agency, chooses to die as close to a dragonrider's death as she can.

Fighting at a funeral

Episode 7 of House of the Dragon takes us to Driftmark for Laena's funeral, where Prince Aemond Targaryen tames and rides Laena's old dragon, Vhagar. When he lands, Rhaenyra's children, as well as Laena's daughters Baela and Rhaena, attack him in anger. In the ensuing brawl, Lucerys Velaryon takes out one of Aemond's eyes. In Fire & Blood, this sequence actually happens at Laenor's funeral (more on that later), and Baela and Rhaena aren't involved. However, in moving the Aemond fight and emphasizing Baela and Rhaena's grief, House of the Dragon is able to ground the scene even deeper in emotion, as well as highlight why the children are so upset. Laena only just died and Aemond is already stealing her dragon? Heck, I'm angry too!

In the aftermath of the children's fight, Alicent demands that Lucerys lose an eye just as Aemond did. She also makes this demand in the book. What she doesn't do in Fire & Blood, but does in the show, is steal Viserys's dagger and try to take Rhaenyra's eye out herself. Alicent's full-on attack perfectly sets up the coming Dance of the Dragons, and it gives us a welcome chance to watch her snap. Throughout the show, Alicent has been composed and calculated, always doing what's asked of her while she sees Rhaenyra flouting her marriage entirely. Here, her frustration and rage get the best of her in an explosive scene that's one of the show's best so far. Olivia Cooke's delivery of "Where is duty? Where is sacrifice?" will go down in House of the Dragon history, along with Emma d'Arcy's whispered, "Now they see you as you are."

Laenor lives!

Congratulations on surviving! Credit: Ollie Upton / HBO

For what might be the first time ever, a Game of Thrones show lets one of the characters that died in its source material walk away unscathed. Laenor, who perishes in a fight with his paramour Ser Qarl in Fire & Blood, doesn't die in House of the Dragon! Instead, he and Qarl fake his death and flee Driftmark to travel across the Narrow Sea. There, they can be open about their love for one another.

How did Laenor and Qarl's escape come about? Well, Rhaenyra and Daemon decide to marry to shore up their power. (Hear that? That's the sound of the Targaryen incest alarms.) However, to get hitched, they need to get Laenor out of the way. Daemon dons the murder cloak he wore to kill his wife and bribes Qarl for a quick death. But he never specifies whose death! Qarl stages Laenor's murder, making it look like he burned in the hearth at Driftmark. As Corlys and Rhaenys mourn their son and Rhaenyra marries Daemon, Qarl and a very much alive Laenor head out to sea.

This is easily the biggest change Fire & Blood makes from its source material, especially given George R.R. Martin's penchant for killing his characters. However, it's unclear whether Laenor's survival will impact the plot moving forward. Everyone thinks he's dead, and why would he and Qarl return to Westeros when they can be happy elsewhere? As sides in the Dance of the Dragons solidify, there's one thing we can be sure of: Somewhere in Essos, Laenor and Qarl are living happy, lavish lives thanks to Daemon's bribe money. It's as close to a fairy-tale ending as Game of Thrones can get.

The petition for Driftmark

"Lord of the Tides," episode 8 of House of the Dragon, revolves around various characters' petitions to become Lord of Driftmark should Corlys pass away. Contenders include Rhaenyra's son and the named heir Lucerys, whose claim has been questioned due to his parentage; Rhaenys, Corlys's wife; and Vaemond Velaryon, Corlys's younger brother in the show (and nephew in Fire & Blood). While the question of succession is addressed in the book, the petitions are new additions for the show: another example of House of the Dragon expanding on briefly mentioned crises in Martin's work.

Also new is Vaemond's death, which deserves a special shout-out here. Vaemond does die in the book after accusing Lucerys of being a bastard. Rhaenyra sends Daemon to kill him and then feeds his corpse to her dragon, Syrax. However in the show, Daemon straight-up chops through his head in the middle of the Red Keep's throne room. It's a major power move and a classic out-of-nowhere Game of Thrones-style death. Sliced and diced.

RIP Viserys

Good night, sweet prince. Er, king. Credit: Ollie Upton / HBO

King Viserys finally shuffles off the mortal coil in this episode. We all saw it coming; he's been marked for blood since day one. However, we never anticipated just how that death would play out in House of the Dragon. In Fire & Blood, Viserys grows old and dies in his sleep. In House of the Dragon, the man goes full Crypt Keeper. He's rotting off his own bones, he's losing body parts left and right... He's just going through it. Finally, at the end of "Lord of the Tides," he passes away. And just after a relatively happy family dinner, no less!

But this being House of the Dragon, we won't know peace yet. That's because right before he dies, Viserys mentions the Song of Ice and Fire prophecy to Alicent, believing her to be Rhaenyra. After hearing a few mumbled words about Aegon (the Conqueror, not Alicent's son, although she has no way of knowing it) and uniting the kingdom, Alicent believes Viserys wants his son to take the throne instead of Rhaenyra. No, Viserys, why couldn't you just keep your mouth shut? The future was looking somewhat bright, at least by Westerosi standards, but your last words may have divided the Seven Kingdoms forever. Bring on the Dance of the Dragons.

We're crowning Aegon! We just have to find him first.

Episode 9 of House of the Dragon, titled "The Green Council," picks up right where episode 8 left off: with Viserys dying and Alicent interpreting his last words as him choosing Aegon as his successor. As soon as Otto gets word of this, he springs into action, gathering the Small Council to organize Aegon's coronation. The only problem? Aegon is nowhere to be found. So sets in motion a hunt for the king-to-be, a hunt that surprisingly pits Alicent against Otto. The Hand wants to kill Rhaenyra and her family as soon as possible, but Alicent has doubts about that, especially following their slight reconciliation last episode.

Much of the search for Aegon is new to the show, as is the tension between Otto and Alicent. In the book, they are a united front as they work to rouse and crown Aegon. Here, Otto is the heartless monster who sets things in motion, while Alicent comes off as much more sympathetic thanks to her worry for Rhaenyra.

House of the Dragon also greatly speeds up the time between Viserys's dying and Aegon's coronation. In the book, it takes about 10 days to finalize the choice to crown Aegon, during which the smell of Viserys's corpse stinks up the Red Keep. Here, Otto and Alicent move fast, plus the show adds a bunch of new material, like Aemond and Criston's discussions, Larys and Alicent's "arrangement," and Mysaria's involvement. (The street urchin fighting rings are very much in Fire & Blood.) The entire expanded search for Aegon emphasizes just how much of a pawn he is in the schemes of older characters. Plus, in seeing all his common haunts (again, the child fights!) we realize just how unfit he is to be king. Pair that with the fact that neither of his parents truly love him and the extreme ego boost he gets from the crowd's cheering at his coronation, and you're looking at a recipe for a megalomaniac disaster.

Rhaenys crashes a coronation

Rhaenys takes matters into her own hands — and it's amazing. Credit: Ollie Upton / HBO

The absolute coolest moment of "The Green Council" is nowhere to be seen in Fire & Blood. The Hightowers lock Rhaenys in the Red Keep and try to win her (and her dragon Meleys) over to their side. However, Ser Erryk Cargyll, a knight of the Kingsguard who decides to back Rhaenyra's claim over Aegon's, helps her escape. She winds up in the dragon pit for the coronation and sneaks away to grab her dragon and get the heck out of dodge.

What follows is a moment of absolute and total badassery. Rhaenys and Meleys crash through the floor of the dragon pit, interrupting a coronation that had otherwise been going pretty well. Meleys turns on Alicent and Aegon, but Rhaenys does not issue the kill order. Perhaps she is trying to limit bloodshed, or she finds Alicent's protection of Aegon moving enough to spare her. Whatever the reason, Rhaenys certainly makes a big splash at the coronation before taking her Valyrian exit (which is what I call flying out of large gatherings on dragonback).

The showdown at Storm's End

The centerpiece of the Season 1 finale of House of the Dragon is undoubtedly the standoff between Lucerys Velaryon and Aemond Targaryen at Storm's End, the seat of House Baratheon. Both have come to secure Lord Borros Baratheon's support: Lucerys for his mother Rhaenyra, and Aemond for his brother Aegon. Borros sides with Aemond, and to make everything worse, Aemond demands that Lucerys take out an eye in exchange for taking his years ago. After Lucerys refuses, the two take to the skies on their dragons for a tense chase, which culminates in Aemond losing control of Vhagar, and Vhagar eating Lucerys.

The broad strokes of the Storm's End sequence play out pretty faithfully to Fire & Blood, but there are still some differences. In the book, Aemond is about to let Lucerys go before one of Borros's daughters goads him into going after him. Here, House of the Dragon streamlines the process: Aemond hasn't quite finished having fun with his nephew yet, so he follows him on his dragon Vhagar. It reads more like a schoolyard tyrant kicking a victim when he's down than someone hellbent on killing.

That difference in intent — scaring as opposed to outright killing — marks the finale's biggest change from Fire & Blood. Here, Lucerys' death is a result of Aemond's failure to keep Vhagar in line, not a direct command from Aemond himself. The fight between Vhagar and Lucerys's dragon Arrax isn't too detailed in the book, so it's possible a similar accident occurred but was not recorded in history. However, the aftermath of the fight, including Aemond returning to King's Landing expecting a hero's welcome, suggests that his kinslaying actions were all too intentional. In House of the Dragon, the kinslaying is a preventable tragedy, as well as a reminder of just how powerful dragons are. Sometimes, age-old creatures of immense power will rebel against their riders — who could have guessed?

One word: war! With Aegon's ascension and Lucerys' death, the Dance of the Dragons is officially in full swing. And based on the look in Rhaenyra's eyes at the very end of the finale, the Blacks are going to retaliate against the Greens in a big way.

Season 2 will likely open with Jacaerys's arrival in Winterfell to gain the support of the North, but plenty of chaos will still be raging in the South as the struggle for power continues. We'll see one of Westerosi history's most brutal moments yet (no spoilers, but look up Blood and Cheese if you're curious). Daemon's interaction with the dragon Vermithor in the finale also suggests that he's going to attempt to find new dragonriders to help boost Rhaenyra's number, so get excited for more dragon battles.

Finally, since House of the Dragon has focused so much energy on fleshing out the relationship between Rhaenyra and Alicent, the evolution of their dynamic in the war to come will surely play a large role as well. Although after everything that's happened, I doubt we'll be seeing them reconcile any time soon.

Final verdict

House of the Dragon takes on the daunting task of adapting a "historical account" full of ambiguity, and creates a haunting portrait of a family torn apart by power. The expansion and centering of the friendship between Rhaenyra and Alicent works wonders and provides both characters — but especially Alicent — a much-needed humanity that we don't always get from Fire & Blood's historical retelling. House of the Dragon is also able to expand on some key Fire & Blood moments in new and exciting ways, giving us new scenes like Rhaenyra and Daemon's face-off on Dragonstone in episode 2 and the entirety of Rhaenyra and Laenor's very chaotic wedding.

Not every change works. The focus on Aegon the Conqueror's prophecy reeks of an attempt to connect to the plot of Game of Thrones, and the time jumps can get a little confusing. Plus, all the hopping around in time leads us to miss some moments that would have been great to see on screen. Who wouldn't have wanted to watch Laena tame Vhagar, or see the beginnings of Rhaenyra and Harwin Strong's courtship?

Overall, though, House of the Dragon knocks it out of the park as an adaptation, taking the weighty history of Martin's work and making sure to flesh out all the small character moments over ten episodes. House of the Dragon has already been renewed for a Season 2, so we can hopefully expect more excellent adaptation choices — and dragons — in the near future.
Breaking two Spotify records in one day? For Taylor Swift that's no snow on the beach.

Over the course of 24 hours, Swift's Midnights broke the record for most streamed album on Spotify in a single day, the streaming platform announced Saturday. But that wasn't the only record Swift broke. She also became the most streamed artist in a single day on Spotify. Looks like her wacky promo and partnership with Spotify paid off.

In response to the news, Swift tweeted, "How did I get this lucky, having you guys out here doing something this mind blowing?! Like what even just happened??!?!"

The 13 tracks of Midnights debuted Oct. 21 at midnight (shocking) and then Swift surprised fans with an additional seven songs at 3 a.m. releasing Midnights (3am Edition). Swifties and casual listeners alike had a lot of new music to devour and the numbers reflect that.

Only time will tell what record the mastermind will break next.

When We Were Young music festival attendees are not okay (they promise).

Yesterday (Oct. 23), the inaugural When We Were Young music festival that featured mid-2000s emo artists like My Chemical Romance and Paramore, canceled its Saturday performances last minute due to high winds. Variety reports that some attendees found out about the cancellation as late as 10:30 a.m. when doors were set to open only half an hour later.

The remaining dates of the festival on Sunday, Oct. 23, and Oct. 29 "are moving forward accordingly." Ticket holders who purchased tickets through the festival's ticketing service will receive a refund within 30 days, but the festival did not offer attendees the option to transfer their ticket to one of the other two dates.

"When We Were Young Festival organizers have spent the last several days proactively preparing the festival grounds for a windy Saturday. The National Weather Service has now upgraded their Saturday forecast to a High Wind Warning, including dangerous 30-40 mph sustained winds with potential 60 mph gusts," the festival’s statement reads. "Under advisement of the National Weather Service and the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, we have no other choice than to cancel today’s When We Were Young Festival. The safety of our fans, artists and staff will always be our top priority."

Many bands, like We The Kings and The All-American Rejects tried to make the best of the situation by hosting pop-up shows in Vegas, but these events didn't have the capacity to accommodate all the festival attendees.

The festival's lineup sent social media users into a frenzy when it was announced thanks to its nostalgia-inducing acts and similarity to Warped Tour. The festival's Saturday cancelation had Twitter once again ablaze with attendees sharing their disappointment and airing their grievances.

It wasn't just attendees who got in on the conversation. Curious onlookers enjoyed the spectacle of adults decked out in their finest emo attire wandering around Vegas with nowhere to go and others cashed in on the moment by making jokes and memes.

There's no simple way to sum up a parent's job, but one phrase comes to mind: Swiss Army knife.

Ready to problem-solve any situation, many parents can jury-rig a broken shoelace on the way to school, scramble to retrieve forgotten sports equipment before a big tournament, calm panic over a looming math quiz, and console a heartbroken teenager.

Every time, parents hope they'll rise to the challenge by offering their child an ideal combination of emotional and practical support along with firm guidance. But sometimes they're overwhelmed, get frustrated, and fall short of their own expectations. Whatever the case, the ability to handle the unpredictable trials of parenthood rests partly on an adult's social-emotional skills.

If this term sounds familiar, it's because social-emotional learning, or SEL, is now a common part of classroom curriculum in schools across the U.S. SEL is meant to support young students' well-being and academic performance by helping them cultivate self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, relationship skills, and responsible decision-making.

Though SEL strategies are billed as beneficial for kids, parents need them, too. The highs and lows of parenting all but require the ability to deal with a wide range of emotions, sometimes all at once. Yet adults rarely learned how to do this during childhood, and parents don't receive much support for developing this skill once they've got kids of their own.

Dr. Jill Emanuele, Ph.D., a psychologist and vice president of clinical training at the Child Mind Institute, offers a relatable way of thinking about this dynamic by posing a question: "How do you manage your emotions so you act in a manner that's consistent with who you are and your values?"

Plenty of parents are desperate for answers to this question. They want to stop shouting at their mid-tantrum toddler or to enforce screen-time rules without resorting to threats. While there's plenty of valuable advice featured in podcasts, newsletters, private Facebook groups, and TikTok and Instagram parenting accounts, surprisingly straightforward SEL strategies can also make a big difference: pausing, tending to basic needs, self-soothing, practicing self-compassion, and seeking support when it's needed.

Emanuele says that in addition to adopting SEL skills, it's important for parents to reflect on what's making it harder to manage their emotions effectively. When parents understand what they feel, how that informs their thinking, and how those thoughts influence their behavior, they can better handle the emotional turmoil of parenting. That said, there are certain experiences and circumstances, like financial strain, racism, or a global pandemic, that make it harder to cope. Though SEL strategies can't fix those problems, they can help parents develop a more positive relationship with themselves, and as a result, more loving, supportive interactions with their kids.

Here are five parenting SEL skills to consider using:

1. Pause

Parenting isn't filled with that many moments of silence. Instead, it's more like a nonstop pinball game in which parents feel like they're careening from one moment (or meltdown) to the next. Emanuele says parents should focus on pausing when possible to reflect on what's happening in that moment, including what they're thinking or feeling. This is a particularly important skill to use when a parent acts in a way that doesn't feel good or right to them.

"What happens is we get so overwhelmed that we don't actually stop to think about what's happening here," she says. "We just kind of go down the rabbit hole of emotional hell or continue to do things that don't work."

"What happens is we get so overwhelmed that we don't actually stop to think about what's happening here." - Dr. Jill Emanuele, psychologist and vice president of clinical training at the Child Mind Institute

Pausing, then staying in the moment, is about taking stock of feelings and behavior. Emanuele acknowledges how hard this can be. It might feel uncomfortable when a parent actually wants to avoid their emotions instead. The act of pausing can help stop runaway emotions and impulsivity, thereby helping a parent respond to the situation in a way that reflects their values and intentions.

Practicing this throughout the day when the stakes are low helps strengthen pausing as a skill, too. Emanuele recommends, for example, that parents put a smartphone aside instead of picking it up 10 times in 15 minutes, and briefly contemplate how they feel.

She also points out that parents who grew up without high-speed internet or smart devices know from their own childhood that there used to be moments when nothing was happening, which made it easier to be aware of emotions or thoughts. In other words, pauses were easy to come by.

"We don't have that anymore, so we have to make them," she says.

2. Sleep and eat well

Developmental psychologist Dr. Tia Kim, Ph.D., says that one of her go-to SEL strategies is self-care. Specifically, Kim focuses on the importance of sleeping and eating well because it helps people develop a "positive emotional baseline."

"It seems very basic, but just regulating those things so you're in a fresh place to be able to make good decisions and manage your emotions when there are stressful situations," is important, says Kim, vice president of education, research, and impact at Committee for Children, a global nonprofit organization that develops SEL curricula.

High-quality sleep and nutritious food may not be consistently available to parents for a variety of reasons, but adults who simply have an awareness that they're hangry or exhausted are in a better position to handle stress. Instead of becoming frustrated with a cranky kid who hasn't eaten enough, a parent might say, "Hey, I'm also hungry, and when I'm hungry it's hard for me to stay calm. Can we stop and have a snack together?"

Sleeping and eating well are surprisingly overlooked self-care techniques. Other strategies needn't be elaborate: Five minutes of meditation, drinking water throughout the day, taking a regular 15-minute walk, or journaling all count as acts of self-care that can help parents manage stress. In general, Kim recommends designing a self-care routine, sticking with the plan as much as possible, and tracking progress, which helps people form new habits.

3. Practice self-soothing

Parents who hear the phrase "self-soothing" might flash back to their child's infancy. The hope — and dream — at that stage is that a baby will learn to soothe themselves after waking from sleep, maybe with a pacifier, stuffed animal, or favorite blanket. But self-soothing isn't just for babies.

Emanuele says parents should develop simple strategies to help counter stress. In therapy, Emanuele teaches children these skills using the five senses, and adds movement as a sixth sense. Self-soothing based on touch could mean hugging a loved one or petting an animal. Listening to a favorite musician taps into the hearing sense. Noticing a beautiful sunset while driving draws on sight. These activities can help change mood and redirect a parent who feels stressed out.

While parents might turn to alcohol, drugs, or food to relieve tension, Emanuele says it's important to choose carefully. A glass of wine or slice of cake might feel like a well-deserved treat, but it could be an ineffective coping skill when it makes an adult's emotions "wonky" by amplifying anxiety or affecting blood sugar. The point isn't to necessarily abstain from so-called vices, but rather to understand that they might work against a parent's self-soothing efforts. Alternatively, parents might enjoy a drink when they're not feeling overwhelmed. And when emotions have become too much, they can try self-soothing methods like putting on an impromptu dance party or reading a good book.

"It's really important to always be thinking, 'Is this actually going to help me stay regulated or stay even?'" she says. If the answer is no, try something else.

4. Be compassionate with yourself

So much parenting advice can make caregivers feel like they have to be perfectly calibrated at all times. They must be warm enough that their child feels emotionally connected to them, but also be an authoritative adult who sets reasonable boundaries without becoming a harsh authoritarian. This can leave parents wondering if they're allowed to make mistakes or have intense emotions.

Kim says that this kind of pressure isn't manageable or realistic. Parents will screw up, melt down, and lose their temper.

"It's fine to have really strong emotions, but how you manifest them in a particular setting, you might have to regulate that," she says.

When parents realize they haven't handled their feelings well, they can practice self-compassion instead of berating or shaming themselves. Kim says that social-emotional development, including positively managing emotions, is a lifelong process. When parents offer themselves kindness in the wake of disappointing behavior, it can help them learn and grow from what happened. It also models for children that their parent can cope with making a mistake and talk through it, rather than dwell on the misstep and insist on perfection.

A common misperception of self-compassion is that it's a permission slip that excuses certain actions. Instead, think of it like an acknowledgement of vulnerability and a commitment to do better next time.

5. Seek help and support when you need it

It's hard to imagine a parent on the planet who doesn't want or need more support, especially in the midst of a pandemic. A recent survey of parents by the Child Mind Institute found that more than half of respondents said they, or they and their children, experienced a traumatic event during the pandemic, including the death of a family member, loss of a parent's job, and food insecurity. Enduring trauma can certainly make coping with everyday stress that much harder.

"When adults have strong emotional skills, it helps them be role models." - Dr. Tia Kim, developmental psychologist at the Committee for Children

Emanuele says it's critical that caregivers assess how they're functioning and consider seeking help for their emotional and psychological well-being. Parents experiencing trauma, anxiety, and depression might reflect on whether they're behaving in typical ways or struggling more often than not. If they've been having trouble for awhile, or are unable to perform daily activities and tasks, they should consider receiving care to treat any mental health issues. (It's worth noting that economic and workplace policies, including pandemic stimulus payments and predictable scheduling, have been shown to boost well-being, indicating that systems can play a powerful role in improving people's mental health.)

While asking for support can be hard, SEL strategies alone likely won't be enough to help someone recover from a mental health crisis or condition, says Emanuele. Receiving high-quality care can make a profound difference for parents and their children. This includes improving a parent's capacity for handling tough emotions.

In general, practicing SEL strategies is not only good for parents, it also has benefits for their kids, says Kim: "When adults have strong emotional skills, it helps them be role models."

Babe, wake up! #TS10 is here, and Taylor Swift remains our modern-day Shakespeare. Her catchy hooks, and creative, lyrical turns of phrase always seem to work their way into our vernacular (see: "Sad, Beautiful, Tragic" and "casually cruel"). She continues to evolve musically, but we can always count on her for poignant lyrics that only Swift can pen. Expertly articulating the overlooked minutiae of daily life and interior thoughts of a millennial is her signature style.

Midnights is full of these intimate moments. They run the gamut of Swift's three song categories , described last month in her acceptance speech for Songwriter-Artist of the Decade at the Nashville Songwriter Awards — the peppy, not-too-serious "glitter gel pen" songs; the poetic, personal stories of "fountain pen" songs; and the old-fashioned, transportive "quill pen" songs.

But some stand out from the rest as being just so Taylor. Bonus points were awarded for her strong suits: self-referential lyrics, lyrics that mention a color or time of day, lyrics that mention cats, lyrics that mention New York, and lyrics about her main muse, Joe Alwyn.

Here are the top 10 most quintessentially "Taylor" lyrics on Midnights:

"And I lost you. The one I was dancing with in New York. No shoes." - "Maroon"

A double whammy in this line from "Maroon" with both a New York mention and an allusion to dancing with your beloved. Not to mention the very Swiftian detail of "no shoes."

"I picked the petals. He loves me not. Something different bloomed, writing in my room." - "You're On Your Own, Kid"

This is in the running for the top lyric on the album. A three-line summation of her career and an ode to her origin story, all while using lovely floral imagery.

"My boy was a montage — a slow-motion, love potion." - "Midnight Rain"

Add this to the Taylor Swift Hall of Fame of metaphors describing the men she loves.

"'Cause I don’t remember who I was before you painted all my nights a color I’ve searched for." - "Question...?"

Swift excellently makes sweeping declarations of love and its impact on her worldview, and she's particularly fond of using colors and painting as a metaphor to portray that cosmic shift.

"Draw the cat eye, sharp enough to kill a man." - "Vigilante Shit"

The opening lines of "Vigilante Shit" are quintessential Reputation-era Taylor and nod to her go-to make-up style. The red lipstick is implied.

"So put me in the basement, when I want the penthouse of your heart." - "Bejeweled"

Domestic bliss and conflict is always a theme in Swift's music, whether literally or most often, metaphorically. Make that house metaphor an aspirational plea for unconditional love directed at your beau? It's an award-winning Swift line!

"Karma is a cat, purring in my lap ‘cause it loves me." - "Karma"

Meredith, Olivia, and Benjamin know this best. If there’s one thing Swift is going to do, it’s remind us that she’s a proud cat lady!

"Spider boy, king of thieves, weave your little webs of opacity.” - "Karma"

It’s giving "Mean." It’s giving "King of My Heart." It’s giving "The Archer." It’s giving Swift lyricism at its finest.

"I’m only cryptic and Machiavellian 'cause I care." - "Mastermind"

Swifties are whipping out their dictionaries again for this "quill pen" song that combines her love for obscure vocabulary and playfully winking at the listener.

"Sip quiet by my side in the shade. And not the kind that’s thrown, I mean, the kind under where a tree has grown." - "Paris"

This lyric is a trifecta of Taylor: romantic plant language, a callback to earlier lyrics about the cultural definition of "shade" ("You Need to Calm Down"), and drinking.
Babe, wake up! #TS10 is here, and Taylor Swift remains our modern-day Shakespeare. Her catchy hooks, and creative, lyrical turns of phrase always seem to work their way into our vernacular (see: "Sad, Beautiful, Tragic" and "casually cruel"). She continues to evolve musically, but we can always count on her for poignant lyrics that only Swift can pen. Expertly articulating the overlooked minutiae of daily life and interior thoughts of a millennial is her signature style.

Midnights is full of these intimate moments. They run the gamut of Swift's three song categories , described last month in her acceptance speech for Songwriter-Artist of the Decade at the Nashville Songwriter Awards — the peppy, not-too-serious "glitter gel pen" songs; the poetic, personal stories of "fountain pen" songs; and the old-fashioned, transportive "quill pen" songs.

But some stand out from the rest as being just so Taylor. Bonus points were awarded for her strong suits: self-referential lyrics, lyrics that mention a color or time of day, lyrics that mention cats, lyrics that mention New York, and lyrics about her main muse, Joe Alwyn.

Here are the top 10 most quintessentially "Taylor" lyrics on Midnights:

"And I lost you. The one I was dancing with in New York. No shoes." - "Maroon"

A double whammy in this line from "Maroon" with both a New York mention and an allusion to dancing with your beloved. Not to mention the very Swiftian detail of "no shoes."

"I picked the petals. He loves me not. Something different bloomed, writing in my room." - "You're On Your Own, Kid"

This is in the running for the top lyric on the album. A three-line summation of her career and an ode to her origin story, all while using lovely floral imagery.

"My boy was a montage — a slow-motion, love potion." - "Midnight Rain"

Add this to the Taylor Swift Hall of Fame of metaphors describing the men she loves.

"'Cause I don’t remember who I was before you painted all my nights a color I’ve searched for." - "Question...?"

Swift excellently makes sweeping declarations of love and its impact on her worldview, and she's particularly fond of using colors and painting as a metaphor to portray that cosmic shift.

"Draw the cat eye, sharp enough to kill a man." - "Vigilante Shit"

The opening lines of "Vigilante Shit" are quintessential Reputation-era Taylor and nod to her go-to make-up style. The red lipstick is implied.

"So put me in the basement, when I want the penthouse of your heart." - "Bejeweled"

Domestic bliss and conflict is always a theme in Swift's music, whether literally or most often, metaphorically. Make that house metaphor an aspirational plea for unconditional love directed at your beau? It's an award-winning Swift line!

"Karma is a cat, purring in my lap ‘cause it loves me." - "Karma"

Meredith, Olivia, and Benjamin know this best. If there’s one thing Swift is going to do, it’s remind us that she’s a proud cat lady!

"Spider boy, king of thieves, weave your little webs of opacity.” - "Karma"

It’s giving "Mean." It’s giving "King of My Heart." It’s giving "The Archer." It’s giving Swift lyricism at its finest.

"I’m only cryptic and Machiavellian 'cause I care." - "Mastermind"

Swifties are whipping out their dictionaries again for this "quill pen" song that combines her love for obscure vocabulary and playfully winking at the listener.

"Sip quiet by my side in the shade. And not the kind that’s thrown, I mean, the kind under where a tree has grown." - "Paris"

This lyric is a trifecta of Taylor: romantic plant language, a callback to earlier lyrics about the cultural definition of "shade" ("You Need to Calm Down"), and drinking.
Three films poised to be 2022 awards season contenders have one four-legged critter in common: the donkey. That's right — the barnyard animal whose most famous onscreen representation thus far is in Shrek is now getting its time in the prestige spotlight.

The three films in question are Ruben Östlund's Palme d'Or-winning satire Triangle of Sadness, Martin McDonagh's heralded dark comedy The Banshees of Inisherin, and Jerzy Skolimowski's donkey odyssey EO. Out of all three, the last, which is Poland's submission for the Oscar's Best International Feature, is the most donkey-centric, following its titular animal EO's meandering voyage through Europe. However, donkeys play a major part in both Triangle of Sadness and The Banshees of Inisherin, serving as turning points in each film. Unfortunately for the donkeys, these turning points are ones of tragedy.

The donkey in The Banshees of Inisherin is named Jenny (played by a donkey named Jenny) and she is main character Pádraic's (Colin Farrell) animal companion. He dotes on her and lets her in the home, much to the dismay of his sister (Kerry Condon). When Pádraic's best friend Colm (Brendan Gleeson) no longer wants to speak to Pádraic, patient and loyal Jenny is the only one who comes close to filling the Colm-shaped hole in Pádraic's life. She's basically his therapy donkey, following him on long walks and through tough days.

Unfortunately, Jenny will leave a hole of her own.

Colm lays down an ultimatum that if Pádraic speaks to him again, he will cut off his own fingers. But that's not all. Colm pitches the punishing digits at Pádraic's home, where they bounce bloodily off the front door. Then, Jenny gets her hands — er, hooves — on one of these fingers and attempts to gobble it down. She chokes on the dismembered digit and dies, leaving Pádraic with a deceased donkey, a grim mess, and a bone to pick with his (former) best friend.

The donkey in Triangle of Sadness suffers a similarly sad demise.

In Östlund's bleak comedy, obscenely wealthy passengers on a luxurious cruise get marooned on a deserted island along with some of the ship's staff. There, survivors hear a frightening animal cry at night. After several sleepless nights of terror, they go hunting and discover the menacing noise comes from an injured donkey, which they find lying on its side. In one of Triangle of Sadness's most horrifying scenes, the marooned decide they'll kill and eat the creature to survive. But their clumsy attempt to kill it with a rock leads to a horridly prolonged slaughter.

We don't see any of the gore, but we do hear the donkey's weakening cries. Later, as the characters prepare to eat the donkey, it's impossible for them — or us — to forget those haunting noises.

Neither Triangle of Sadness nor The Banshees of Inisherin treat these deaths lightly. Instead, the films take time to consider the heaviness and the tragic nature of these donkeys' passing. In both cases, the donkeys are innocents caught in a downward spiral of human violence. However, their deaths lead to even more violence, essentially serving as a point of no return for both films' characters.

Jenny's death sets in motion The Banshees of Inisherin's destructive third act, where Pádraic seeks revenge on a grander scale than simply dispatching Colm's own dog. In fact, he saves Colm's dog, perhaps looking to spare an innocent on his otherwise hellbent quest for retribution. Meanwhile, the donkey's death in Triangle of Sadness eerily hints at one of the film's final scenes, which sees one character raising a rock over an unsuspecting survivor's head. Whether the blow falls is left ambiguous, but in that moment we can't help but think of that poor, doomed donkey.

While the donkeys in The Banshees of Inisherin and Triangle of Sadness are sidekicks and/or victims, EO places its equine protagonist squarely at its center and provides him with an interiority not granted to Jenny or the island donkey. Still, without spoiling EO, which has yet to be theatrically released in the United States, it's safe to say that death is a constant worry for the film's main donkey (played by six different donkeys named Taco, Ola, Marietta, Ettore, Rocco, and Mela). As EO wanders the European countryside alone, the possibility for injury lurks around every corner: Predators, cruel humans, and more pose threats to him along his travels. It's worth noting that despite this sense of peril, no animals were harmed in the making of EO.

Like Jenny and the unnamed island donkey, Eo is positioned as an innocent in a human world where he has little control. How is he to know why certain humans turn on him while others care for him? How could Jenny have known about Colm and Pádraic's fight? And how could the island donkey have known that her cries for help would be met not with compassion, but with death?

With their soulful eyes and ambling demeanor, donkeys become the perfect gentle figures for McDonagh, Östlund, and Skolimowski to place at the center of their films' chaos and pain — and not just because they're adorable.

Donkeys often occupy a space in the mind as beasts of burden, dutifully serving humans or, in the case of The Banshees of Inisherin, even acting as friends. Their close relationship with us makes these films' acts of very human violence even more jarring. We're not just watching a death: We're seeing a violation of trust. And in the world of Triangle of Sadness and The Banshees of Inisherin, that violation is not something our characters can come back from.

In the end, The Banshees of Inisherin, Triangle of Sadness, and EO make for a strange, deeply sad triptych of donkey-centric movies. Truly, all three films' portrayals of human-animal interactions and betrayals will make you feel like you've been kicked in the chest. And yes, it will feel like that kick has been delivered by a donkey. Honestly, after everything these movies have put them through? Good for them.

Triangle of Sadness and The Banshees of Inisherin are now in theaters. EO hits select New York theaters Nov. 18 and opens in Los Angeles theaters Dec. 2.

Monsters come in all different shapes and sizes.

There are big ones, little ones, scary ones, cuddly ones, and more than a fair few gory ones — all of which come into play at some point on this list.

From the invisible demons of Bird Box to the gentle giants found in Okja, we've tracked down some of the best monster movies on Netflix.

1. A Monster Calls

Connor (Lewis MacDougall) finds solace from threats in "A Monster Calls." Credit: focus features

Channelling the dark fantasy vibes of Pan's Labyrinth (also on this list), J.A. Bayona's A Monster Calls tells the story of a bullied teenage boy, Conor, who's struggling to process his mother's terminal illness. One night the yew tree behind his house comes to life and visits him, explaining that it will tell him three stories if Conor tells it a fourth in return. Like all the best fantasies, this beautiful movie is packed with symbolism, seamlessly weaving the fantasy elements with a poignant coming-of-age story about grief. Fair warning: you're probably not going to finish this one with dry eyes.

2. Before I Wake

If you're in the mood for a good scare you could do a lot worse than Before I Wake, a chilly nightmare-made-real from The Haunting of Hill House creator Mike Flanagan. At the centre of the story are Jessie (Kate Bosworth) and Mark (Thomas Jane), recently bereaved parents who welcome a young orphan named Cody (Jacob Tremblay) into their home. But something odd happens when Cody goes to sleep, and soon the pair find themselves in a nightmarish cat-and-mouse with a creature called the Canker Man. The jumps come thick and fast in this one, so make sure you have a suitably large cushion to cower behind.

3. Bird Box

OK, so the monsters in Bird Box aren't technically visible, but that doesn't make them any less real/terrifying. Directed by Susanne Bier and based on Josh Malerman's novel of the same name, Bird Box is a post-apocalyptic thriller set in a world in which everyone has to cover their eyes when they go outside — anyone who sees the monsters dies by suicide. It's a premise that makes for some truly nerve-jangling scenes, with Sandra Bullock playing Malorie Hayes, a woman who's forced to take two children on a nightmarish blindfolded journey in an attempt to get to safety. It's one of those films that's over two hours long, but still leaves you wanting more, although it's not without warranted criticism. Importantly, Netflix currently streams the edited version.

4. Bleach

If you like your monsters gigantic and your fight scenes packed with hectic sword-play, Shinsuke Sato's Bleach — which is based on Tite Kubo's manga series — may be the one for you. The story pulls back the curtain on an invisible war being played out between "reapers" (spirits responsible for guiding departed souls to the afterlife) and "hollows" (monstrous creatures hell-bent on consuming the souls of the innocent). At the centre of all this is high school student Ichigo Kurosaki (Sôta Fukushi), who gets caught up in the middle of the battle after a chance meeting with the mysterious Rukia (Hana Sugisaki). This one's worth checking out for the sword-fighting sequences alone — the one at the film's conclusion is awesome — and the creepy mask-wearing hollows, which really are the stuff of nightmares.

5. Sweetheart

Survival-thriller meets horror in J.D. Dillard's story about Jenn (Kiersey Clemons), a woman who washes ashore on a mysterious island that appears to be uninhabited. As Jenn struggles to keep herself alive, though, she soon realises that being stranded isn't the only threat — at night, something emerges from the sea and tries to hunt her down. Dillard's story splices several genres together, but the introduction of other castaways in the second act shines a clear spotlight on the discussion of class divide and white privilege that lies at the heart of the story.

6. Vampires vs. the Bronx

Want a movie that's got excitement, comedy, a scorching message about the evils of gentrification, and is a kid-friendly romp? Then take a bite out of Vampires vs. the Bronx. Oz Perkins's PG-13 horror-comedy centers on Afro-Latino teens, who recognize that a flurry of missing person posters and influx of rich white folks with tote bags means bad news for the neighborhood. Together, they team up Monster Squad-style to take down the bloodsuckers and save their community. With a sharp wit, a warm heart, a rich sense of atmosphere, and an equal appreciation for the Blade movies and '80s Amblin, Vampires vs. the Bronx is an easy watch full of rewards.* —Kristy Puchko, Film Editor

Will Smith faces off against a horde of nocturnal mutants in this tense adaptation of Richard Matheson's post-apocalyptic novel of the same name. With only his trusty German Shepherd, Samantha, for company, Robert Neville (Smith) walks the abandoned husk of New York City by himself, going door-to-door for food while constantly working on a possible cure for the genetically-engineered virus that's ravaged the planet. This one's brilliantly shot and packed full of suspense, but be warned: there are some *difficult* scenes.

8. Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark

After haunting the nightmares of a whole generation of kids, Alvin Schwartz' classic short horror stories are brought to life in André Øvredal's feature-length 2019 movie — one that's prompted people to look back to the source material.

"After reminiscing with my dad and checking my dark apartment for unwelcome strangers, I sought out an online copy of the original stories — an action I would not have taken without the cinematic prompting," wrote Alison Foreman in her Mashable review.

"Late into the night, I relived each of the torments and reveled in the regularly forgotten joke sections of each book. After all these years, those Scary Stories are still being told, now on and off screen.

"And haunted or not, it feels good to be home."

9. Okja

Blending drama with fantasy/adventure and weaving in a very real message about the horrors of the meat industry, Bong Joon-ho's Okja is a beautifully unique creature feature. The film follows Mina (Ahn Seo-hyun), the granddaughter of a farmer in South Korea who has spent the last 10 years rearing a genetically-modified super-pig called Okja as part of a breeding project spearheaded by a grim U.S. corporation. The film is dark in places, magical in others, and poignant overall, asking us to stop and reflect on the dark side of an industry the majority of us are complicit in. Tilda Swinton and Jake Gyllenhaal make for an entertaining pair of villains, too.

10. The Mist

What's lurking in the mist? Credit: Dimension Films/Kobal/Shutterstock

Following a father and son who get trapped in a gas station store with a group of strangers as a weird fog envelops their town, Frank Darabont's The Mist takes an intriguing premise and spins out a tense popcorn-muncher of a film that's equal parts fun, jumpy and harrowing. Based on Stephen King's 1980 novella, it's not a perfect movie — some of the special effects look a little dated here and there – but it's still leagues ahead of most monster movies, and comes complete with a chilling human antagonist and a convincing analogy of the dangers of fundamental religion.*

11. The Ritual

In director David Bruckner's scenic tour of a hellscape, four pals hike through northern Sweden to honor a departed friend. Of course, their trip soon morphs into a torturous and never-ending nightmare — with a killer lead performance by Rafe Spall. Slippery and divisive, this movie begs to be picked apart. More likely than not, you'll love the world it creates but hate the way it ends. Or, like me, you'll love the world it creates and how it ends. Have fun with it! And pack bug spray!* — Alison Foreman, former Entertainment Reporter

The film follows Mina (Ahn Seo-hyun), the granddaughter of a farmer in South Korea who has spent the last 10 years rearing a genetically-modified super-pig called Okja as part of a breeding project spearheaded by a grim U.S. corporation. The film is dark in places, magical in others, and poignant overall, asking us to stop and reflect on the dark side of an industry the majority of us are complicit in. Tilda Swinton and Jake Gyllenhaal make for an entertaining pair of villains, too.

10. The Mist

Following a father and son who get trapped in a gas station store with a group of strangers as a weird fog envelops their town, Frank Darabont's The Mist takes an intriguing premise and spins out a tense popcorn-muncher of a film that's equal parts fun, jumpy and harrowing. Based on Stephen King's 1980 novella, it's not a perfect movie — some of the special effects look a little dated here and there – but it's still leagues ahead of most monster movies, and comes complete with a chilling human antagonist and a convincing analogy of the dangers of fundamental religion.*

In director David Bruckner's scenic tour of a hellscape, four pals hike through northern Sweden to honor a departed friend. Of course, their trip soon morphs into a torturous and never-ending nightmare — with a killer lead performance by Rafe Spall. Slippery and divisive, this movie begs to be picked apart. More likely than not, you'll love the world it creates but hate the way it ends. Or, like me, you'll love the world it creates and how it ends. Have fun with it! And pack bug spray!* — Alison Foreman, former Entertainment Reporter

There's a new Taylor Swift album out this weekend, and all you can think about is the Quordle solution? You must be a huge puzzle fan.

If Quordle is a little too challenging today, you've come to the right place for hints. There aren't just hints here, but the whole Quordle solution. Scroll to the bottom of this page, and there it is. But are you sure you need all four answers? Maybe you just need a strategy guide. Either way, scroll down, and you'll get what you need.

What is Quordle?

Quordle is a five-letter word guessing game similar to Wordle, except each guess applies letters to four words at the same time. You get nine guesses instead of six to correctly guess all four words. It looks like playing four Wordle games at the same time, and that is essentially what it is. But it's not nearly as intimidating as it sounds.

Is Quordle harder than Wordle?

Yes, though not diabolically so.

Where did Quordle come from?

Amid the Wordle boom of late 2021 and early 2022, when everyone was learning to love free, in-browser, once-a-day word guessing games, creator Freddie Meyer says he took inspiration from one of the first big Wordle variations, Dordle — the one where you essentially play two Wordles at once. He took things up a notch, and released Quordle on January 30. Meyer's creation was covered in The Guardian six days later, and now, according to Meyer, it attracts millions of daily users. Today, Meyer earns modest revenue from Patreon, where dedicated Quordle fans can donate to keep their favorite puzzle game running.

How is Quordle pronounced?

“Kwordle.” It should rhyme with “Wordle,” and definitely should not be pronounced exactly like "curdle.”

Is Quordle strategy different from Wordle?

Yes and no.

Your starting strategy should be the same as with Wordle. In fact, if you have a favorite Wordle opening word, there’s no reason to change that here. We suggest something rich in vowels, featuring common letters like C, R, and N. But you do you.

After your first guess, however, you’ll notice things getting out of control if you play Quordle exactly like Wordle.

What should I do in Quordle that I don’t do in Wordle?

Solving a Wordle puzzle can famously come down to a series of single letter-change variations. If you’ve narrowed it down to “-IGHT,” you could guess “MIGHT” “NIGHT” “LIGHT” and “SIGHT” and one of those will probably be the solution — though this is also a famous way to end up losing in Wordle, particularly if you play on “hard mode.” In Quordle, however, this sort of single-letter winnowing is a deadly trap, and it hints at the important strategic difference between Wordle and Quordle: In Quordle, you can't afford to waste guesses unless you're eliminating as many letters as possible at all times.

Guessing a completely random word that you already know isn't the solution, just to eliminate three or four possible letters you haven’t tried yet, is thought of as a desperate, latch-ditch move in Wordle. In Quordle, however, it's a normal part of the player's strategic toolset.

Is there a way to get the answer faster?

In my experience Quordle can be a slow game, sometimes dragging out longer than it would take to play Wordle four times. But a sort of blunt-force guessing approach can speed things up. The following strategy also works with Wordle if you only want the solution, and don’t care about having the fewest possible guesses:

Try starting with a series of words that puts all the vowels (including Y) on the board, along with some other common letters. We've had good luck with the three words: “NOTES,” “ACRID,” and “LUMPY.” YouTuber DougMansLand suggests four words: “CANOE,” “SKIRT,” “PLUMB,” and “FUDGY.”

Most of the alphabet is now eliminated, and you’ll only have the ability to make one or two wrong guesses if you use this strategy. But in most cases you’ll have all the information you need to guess the remaining words without any wrong guesses.

If strategy isn't helping, and you're still stumped, here are some hints:

Are there any double or triple letters in today’s Quordle words?

No.

Are any rare letters being used in today’s Quordle like Q or Z?

No.

What do today’s Quordle words start with?

K, S, G, and F.

What are the answers for today’s Quordle?

Are you sure you want to know?

There’s still time to turn back.

OK, you asked for it. The answers are:

It's Sunday at last, and the new Taylor Swift album isn't the only thing on our minds: there's also a fresh Wordle! But if you're staring at a blank space, we've got some clues and the solution, as we do every day.

If you just want today's word, you can jump straight to the end of this article for October 23's Wordle solution, for puzzle #491. If you'd rather work through it yourself, keep reading for some tips, tricks, and clues.

Where did Wordle come from?

Wordle was initially created by engineer Josh Wardle as a gift for his partner, though it quickly spread until it became an international phenomenon. Thousands of players across the globe tackle Wordle each day, with some fans even having created alternate versions of the daily word puzzle game. These include battle royale format Squabble, music identification game Heardle, and variations like Dordle and Quordle that make you guess multiple words at once.

The popularity of Wordle even reached such heights that the New York Times bought it earlier this year, while TikTok creators live-stream themselves playing it.

What's the best Wordle starting word?

The goal of Wordle is to have fun, and there's no right way to have fun. Just choose whatever starting word feels right to you, and don't let anyone shame you for it. However, if you want to take a more strategic approach, we have a few ideas to help you pick a word that will spark joy. One tip is to select a word that includes at least two different vowels, plus some common consonants like S, T, R, or N.

What happened to the Wordle archive?

The entire archive of past Wordles used to be available for anyone to play in glorious days gone by. Unfortunately it has since been taken down, with the website's creator stating it was done at the request of the New York Times.

Is Wordle getting harder?

If you're finding Wordle too easy, you can try enabling its Hard Mode to give your brain a tougher challenge. But Wordle isn't getting any harder by itself — it's the same difficulty that it's always been.

Why are there two different Wordle answers some days?

Wordle is a fun, collective experience specifically because everyone's solving for the same word every day. Occasionally, though, Wordle has accepted two different solutions as correct on the same day. This is because the New York Times made changes to the Wordle word list after acquiring it, and sometimes swaps out words from the original list. To ensure you're getting the right answer every day, refresh your browser before you play — the site will save your streak.

Here's a subtle hint for today's Wordle answer:

It's a perfect word for Halloween season.

Does today's Wordle answer have a double letter?

It sure does.

Today's Wordle is a 5-letter word that starts with...

The letter... M.

Despite having been released just a day ago, Midnights, the tenth studio album from Taylor Swift is a critical and commercial success. While tracks like "Lavender Haze" and "Sweet Nothing," are about love and revenge, "Anti-Hero," sees Swift battle against herself. So of course, it's set the internet abuzz.

As the lead single to Midnights, "Anti-Hero" is about Swift's insecurities and anxieties in life both publicly and privately. The song itself has been described as a collision of synthpop, neurotic image analysis, and dense lyricism brought together by "a methodical drum loop" and "simmering synths." The track is a depressingly relatable one, as Swift deals with the fear of nothing, anxiety from everything, and doubting the ones she trusts the most.

On Instagram, Swift said the track is her favorite on the album. "This song really is a real guided tour throughout all the things I tend to hate about myself. We all hate things about ourselves," she said. "So yeah, I like 'Anti-Hero' a lot because I think it's really honest."

Swifties and pop heads alike have spent countless hours breaking down every line and phrase in "Anti-Hero" (and we're not even including the music video, which is rife with easter eggs of its own). Each lyrical interpretation paints a different picture, depending on who you're talking to, which app you're on, and just how much Taylor Swift lore you already know. So to help out anyone not in the loop, we've compiled the internet's best (and hottest) takes on the most confusing lines from "Anti-Hero."

I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser

Does old age imply maturity? Swift doesn't feel like this is the case for her. According to Twitter users well-versed in Swift lore, this is a sentiment Swift has expressed for years in her music. In the 2019 song "Archer," Swift sings "I never grew up, it’s getting so old."

It's been pointed out in the past by critics that the singer's actions have been "immature" and "petty" after the release of her 2017 single "Look What You Made Me Do." One critic described the song as "the ramblings of a teenage girl scorned and on a warpath."

It's me, hi / I'm the problem, it's me

Heading down to the chorus is the lyric that'll dominate your Tiktok feed for the next several weeks. Opinions on the correct interpretation of this line differ based on the perspective of the listener. To some, the lyric is Swift's intrusive thoughts, that she knows she's the problem and that she's actually the antihero. She says later in the chorus "It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero."

The statement is repeated later at the end of the track, however, the vocals suggest she's exhausted from having to always admit that she's the problem.

For context, the running joke on the internet is that for every breakup Swift has, she writes an album about the relationship. Swift has been in a lot of relationships with celebrities in the past and is, at times, unfairly and extremely criticized for her dating life and for using that as material for her songs.

As probably the most relatable line on the track for many, Twitter users are letting it be known that they don't appreciate Swift calling them out like this.

Sometimes, I feel like everybody is a sexy baby

This is the line that has confused the internet the most. When you first listen to it, it's weird, jarring, and just comes out of nowhere. Social media users have defended it, pointing out that the line and the subsequent lyric "And I'm a monster on the hill / Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city," is a commentary on the sexualization of youth and innocence.

The "sexy baby" lyric itself is a possible reference to this scene in 30 Rock as Twitter user @parkersrodrigo points out. In the episode titled, "TGS Hates Women" Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) hires a writer named Abby (Cristin Milioti) to join the TGS with Tracy Jordan staff. However, after the meeting, Lemon accuses Abby of putting on a "sexy baby" act for male attention.

While it may or may not be a direct reference, the tragic idea that men prey on young women and only value women by their attractiveness, which in turn causes self-esteem issues in young girls trying to appease the male gaze is still present. Reddit users in the r/TaylorSwift subreddit also agree:

I have this dream my daughter-in-law kills me for the money / She thinks I left them in the will / The family gathers around and reads it...

This is perhaps the most talked-about lyric on the entire album.

Fans have noted a striking similarity between these words from the song's bridge and the 2019 film Knives Out. The imagery of a presumed will-reading gone bad is echoed in the will-reading scene in Knives Out.

However, even though the music video expands on what Swift meant by her dream, some fans have their own ideas about who exactly Swift's dream daughter-in-law is:

It's a pretty fitting summary of the reaction to the album as a whole. These lyrics are definitely about Swift herself, but maybe, just maybe, we the fans fit in there too.

Earlier this year, Google threw a bone at Republicans who felt Gmail unfairly filtered their campaign emails to users’ spam folders. Those same Republicans are now suing Google anyway.

Axios reported that the Republican National Committee (RNC) filed a lawsuit against Google in California for allegedly and unfairly throwing GOP campaign emails to the spam folder at a time when fundraising is especially crucial ahead of the November congressional midterm elections. The lawsuit specifically alleges that said emails get filtered to spam around the end of each month, when fundraising is supposedly at its most fruitful.

This is notable because Google just launched a program in August (with approval from the Federal Election Commission) that individual campaigns can apply for with the intent of stopping emails from getting sent to spam. Per the Axios report, the RNC is not part of this program, though it’s not clear whether that’s by choice or not. If it were, its emails would avoid traditional spam detection and would have a special banner on them signaling that the sender is part of the program.

The GOP’s distrust of Google’s spam filtering gained traction when a study from North Carolina State University apparently found that Republican emails were sent to spam at a higher rate than those sent by Democrats. However, Google has repeatedly denied that this is the case, and Mashable’s own reporting on the subject found that an email sender’s habits are more likely to cause spam filtering than their political affiliation. In other words, if you send a lot of similar emails over and over and they don’t get opened very often, that’s a one-way ticket to Spamville.

Maybe there’s a Google conspiracy against Republicans or maybe the GOP just doesn’t understand how to send emails. Either way, it may go to the courts now.

When choosing a vacation rental, it's important to consider all the amenities: good location, fast Wi-Fi, decent price, comfy beds. But these Airbnb and Vrbo listings offer something extra — a cold shiver down your spine, the feeling of dread, or sounds of creaking and wailing that can't be explained.

If you live for the thrill of paranormal activity and gruesome ghost stories, these listings will surely delight. Otherwise, consider yourself warned...

This Stroud house in North Carolina is so haunted it even comes with a disclaimer:

"Several friends, family, and guests have experienced supernatural events here including: footsteps in the hallway or upstairs, the hall and basement lights turning on randomly, a door opening after being latched closed, a shadowy figure in the kitchen and dining room, glowing orbs in the living room, and even a music box that has played by itself," the listing warns.

But don't worry, the ghosts are benevolent by all accounts.

"None of the incidents have ever been malevolent in nature. We just accept that it is what it is, and continue on with our lives."

Minnesota doesn't exactly scream medieval, but this listing might elicit some screams from its guests.

For $90 a night, you can rent a private room in this mini castle located in St. Paul. The manor's listing mentions the presence of the host's pet — an apparently friendly Doberman named Scorch — and can be rented out for photo shoots, paranormal investigations, rituals, and murder mystery dinners.

The "Haunted Bedroom" at Talliston House and Gardens is the medieval manifestation of your nightmares.

Meticulously designed to look like "the bed chamber of a seven-year-old Edwardian child," this room is decorated with ornate wood paneling, heavy drapes, low lighting, and a bed fit for Henry VIII. If it gets too creepy in here, each room of the house has its own theme, so you can go to the Victorian living room or the New Orleans kitchen to escape the dark ages.

The brief description of the "Madness Chamber" says it is "haunted and is well over 600 years old."

The Yorkshire, UK listing doesn't say much else, but if the wood-paneled walls of this ancient lodging could talk, they'd surely have some spooky stories to tell.

Live like witches in a Salem, Massachusetts listing recreated to look like the famous Sanderson Sisters' abode.

In this cottage, you can brew up some potions, conjure a spell or two, and then jump on your broomstick to terrorize the good people of Salem. This house is so authentic to the 17th century that it wasn't built with modern "facilities." But fret not, a modern outhouse is just steps away.

The "Warlock House," another Salem entry on this list, really leans into the town's history as the site of the Salem Witch Trials.

The Halloween-themed house has all kinds of witchy decor, including a ouija board coffee table, a witches' altar, a crystal ball, and even an Edgar-Allen-Poe-themed bedroom. Perfect for hosting a seance or performing other dark magic.

This listing will see your haunted house and raise you a haunted town.

Terlingua, Texas was a mercury-mining town, complete with a hotel, a commissary, and a school. But by the 1940s the mercury market had crashed, the mine was closed down, and Terlingua was mostly abandoned. What remains is a town perfectly preserved in time, which undoubtedly includes some haunted spirits from its pioneer past.

Another famous guest was former President Lyndon B Johnson. He was alive when he stayed there, but one wonders if he ever makes a paranormal visit.
When choosing a vacation rental, it's important to consider all the amenities: good location, fast Wi-Fi, decent price, comfy beds. But these Airbnb and Vrbo listings offer something extra — a cold shiver down your spine, the feeling of dread, or sounds of creaking and wailing that can't be explained.

If you live for the thrill of paranormal activity and gruesome ghost stories, these listings will surely delight. Otherwise, consider yourself warned...

This Stroud house in North Carolina is so haunted it even comes with a disclaimer:

"Several friends, family, and guests have experienced supernatural events here including: footsteps in the hallway or upstairs, the hall and basement lights turning on randomly, a door opening after being latched closed, a shadowy figure in the kitchen and dining room, glowing orbs in the living room, and even a music box that has played by itself," the listing warns.

But don't worry, the ghosts are benevolent by all accounts.

"None of the incidents have ever been malevolent in nature. We just accept that it is what it is, and continue on with our lives."

Minnesota doesn't exactly scream medieval, but this listing might elicit some screams from its guests.

For $90 a night, you can rent a private room in this mini castle located in St. Paul. The manor's listing mentions the presence of the host's pet — an apparently friendly Doberman named Scorch — and can be rented out for photo shoots, paranormal investigations, rituals, and murder mystery dinners.

The "Haunted Bedroom" at Talliston House and Gardens is the medieval manifestation of your nightmares.

Meticulously designed to look like "the bed chamber of a seven-year-old Edwardian child," this room is decorated with ornate wood paneling, heavy drapes, low lighting, and a bed fit for Henry VIII. If it gets too creepy in here, each room of the house has its own theme, so you can go to the Victorian living room or the New Orleans kitchen to escape the dark ages.

The brief description of the "Madness Chamber" says it is "haunted and is well over 600 years old."

The Yorkshire, UK listing doesn't say much else, but if the wood-paneled walls of this ancient lodging could talk, they'd surely have some spooky stories to tell.

The week is over, and it's time to enjoy a fantastic October weekend. It's scary season, the air is chilled, and it is the perfect time to read some tweets.

Why? Why not, my good friend.

Sure tweets can be awful, but they can also be funny and entertaining. And we did the dirty work of skimming the scum of the internet to pull out the good stuff. In other words, we collected the best and funniest tweets of the week.

So anyway, here they are: the 9 best tweets of the week.

1. This is really silly, and I love it.

2. The thing is Trader Joe's sells good pre-made stuff. But if you need essentials or pantry items? Good luck, buddy.

3. Sometimes that's just how you feel, and Action Bronson gets that.

4. Here's an obligatory dril tweet for you to enjoy.

5.This is an important question about an upcoming film.

6. This is what I did before writing this article.

7. This happens every six months or so in corporate America.

8. I hate this pun so much that I actually love it.

9.Internal monologue: Oh yeah, that would be no problem for me. In reality: Cannot live for more than 20 minutes without a strong internet connection and could not do a single outdoorsy task without thoroughly Googling it first.

Astronomers are finding all sorts of weird worlds.

Some likely rain gems from metallic clouds. Others may be completely covered in sprawling oceans. And scientists now have a new addition to the planets beyond our solar system, called exoplanets: Meet the "fluffy" world TOI-3757 b. Astronomers think it has an atmospheric density similar to a marshmallow.

Weird? Absolutely. But our planet is deeply strange, too. There's no reason to think the universe — a place teeming with hundreds of billions of galaxies that each contain billions of stars and an untold number of planets — wouldn't be, well, otherworldly.

Atop a mountain in Arizona, astronomers at the Kitt Peak National Observatory used a 11.5-foot-wide telescope called WIYN to investigate the gassy Jupiter-like world some 580 light-years away in deep space. It orbits a common though curious type of star called a "red dwarf." These stars are much smaller and dimmer than the sun, but they're awfully fickle: They shoot out violent flares that can make nearby planet's inhospitable. TOI-3757 b is "the lowest-density planet ever detected around a red dwarf star," explains the National Science Foundation's NOIRLab, which runs big telescopes across the U.S.

How did this gassy world get so fluffy?

Planetary scientists suggested two ideas for the planet's marshmallow-like atmosphere:

Gas giants like Jupiter start their lives as rocky cores many times Earth's mass. They use this mass the pull in nearby gas as the solar system forms, according to NOIRLab. But the red dwarf star contains fewer heavy elements than other such stars, meaning the planet's rocky core may have formed slowly and "delayed" the process of pulling in that surrounding gas. Ultimately, TOI-3757 b was left with a less dense, fluffier atmosphere than other Jupiter-like planets orbiting these stars. TOI-3757 b's orbit around its red dwarf star could be elliptical. "There are times it gets closer to its star than at other times, resulting in substantial excess heating that can cause the planet’s atmosphere to bloat," NOIRLab explains.

Planetary scientists will continue to investigate this odd world. And they'll have the help of the most powerful space telescope ever built, the James Webb Space Telescope, or JWST. The telescope carries specialized equipment, called spectrometers , that can sleuth out what the atmospheres of distant, alien worlds are composed of. (Some planets, for example, might contain water, methane, and carbon dioxide, which could mean they're habitable worlds.)

"Potential future observations of the atmosphere of this planet using NASA’s new James Webb Space Telescope could help shed light on its puffy nature," Jessica Libby-Roberts, an author of the new research on TOI-3757 b and a postdoctoral researcher at Pennsylvania State University, said in a statement.

NASA's specialized exoplanet sleuth, a space telescope called TESS, originally spotted this marshmallow world. TESS watches for exoplanets to travel in front of their respective stars, and uses the information it observes from the slight dimming to judge the planet's size and orbit. Astronomers can then use other telescopes to estimate an exoplanet's mass, density, and beyond.

As of October 2022, scientists have confirmed the existence of 5,190 exoplanets, and the agency is working on confirming over 8,000 other objects. There's certainly no evidence that any of these worlds contain life. But a good portion of these realms — particularly large rocky worlds dubbed "super-Earths" — may host conditions that could be temperate, water-rich, and habitable.

Stay tuned, folks. Exoplanet research is heating up. Marshmallow worlds won't be the last wild thing found out there.

While counting snow crabs at sea in 2021, fisheries biologist Erin Fedewa saw that something was deeply amiss.

Fedewa, a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) scientist, spends three or four months with a team that collects crabs from 376 stations in Alaska's Bering Sea each year. Some of these areas always teem with crabs. Scientists count thousands. But in 2021, thousands dwindled to hundreds.

"The survey last year was a huge red flag for me," she told Mashable.

The harbingers proved right. The population of snow crabs has crashed after hitting record highs somewhat recently, in 2018. Numbers have fallen so low, the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, for the first time, canceled the snow crab fishing season this year. The NOAA abundance surveys found the total snow crab population in the eastern Bering Sea dropped from an estimated 11.7 billion in 2018 down to 1.9 billion in 2022 (these surveys are a critical piece, but not the only piece, that NOAA uses to determine long-term population trends). That's a drop of well over 80 percent.

The agency thinks a dramatic episode wiped out billions of the creatures.

"As biologists, all we can point to is some sort of large-scale mortality event," Fedewa said.

And it's an episode NOAA believes was ultimately stoked by exceptionally warm ocean waters in the Arctic. In other words, it could be a consequence of climate change, which can make environmental impacts significantly more extreme.

How the snow crabs could have vanished

The Bering Sea, where crabs have historically flourished, is experiencing momentous upheaval.

"The Bering Sea is changing dramatically right now," Matthew Bracken, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of California, Irvine who researches marine ecosystems and their communities, told Mashable.

The northeast Pacific Ocean experienced a potent marine heat wave — a prolonged period of unusually warm ocean temperatures — in 2019. "That heat wave as well as earlier heat waves have been attributed to climate change," NOAA concluded. (Overall, the Bering Sea experienced unprecedented warming between 2017 and 2019.) That's because, similar to more frequent heat waves on land, marine heat waves are growing more frequent and intense in a warming world. Oceans are absorbing nearly unfathomable amounts of heat, and higher temperatures boost the odds of a marine heat wave occurring and persisting. Human warming of the planet is likely to blame. As researchers concluded in a recent study on marine heat waves in this region, "[temperature] forcing by elevated greenhouse gases levels has virtually certainly caused the multi-year persistent 2019–2021 marine heatwave."

The question that looms large is how this heat stoked a massive die-off of crabs. That is under investigation, but the crucial point is that warmer temperatures can amplify mechanisms of death like increased predation, starvation, and disease. (As the graph above shows, snow crab numbers are already fickle to begin with. The species experienced a dramatic fall in 1999, which may also have been stoked by environmental changes.)

Here's what could have happened in warmer waters:

Loss of sea ice = loss of crab refuge: Unsurprisingly, warmer ocean waters are a major contributor to sea ice declines. In March of 2019, for example, the lackluster Bering Sea ice almost completely disappeared — at a time when this water should have been blanketed in ice. Sea temperatures were above average, and the ice extent was the lowest in the satellite record. This loss of ice doesn't bode well for snow crabs. When bounties of sea ice melts, the water sinks to the sea floor by summer and creates a "cold pool" (of water less than 35.6 degrees Fahrenheit, or 2 degrees Celsius) that's too frigid for predators, like hungry cod, to roam. "That's a refuge for baby crabs," said Bracken. In 2019, there might have been no refuge for baby crabs.

Warmer waters = more disease: Warmer waters allow diseases (like bitter crab syndrome) to thrive. Disease could have spread through the snow crab population. "Whenever you have warming water temperature, that provides a venue for disease to come into the system," Bracken explained. "More pathogens can survive." "The Bering Sea is changing dramatically right now."

It's also possible that, with significantly less sea ice, open waters could have allowed fishing vessels into previously inaccessible areas. Yet NOAA's Fedewa notes an important issue here. The commercial fishing industry targets mature crabs — the type they can sell. Yet the agency found declines across all sizes of crab — not just the targeted crabs — which Fedewa said suggests the population decline was caused by a "bottom-up driver," meaning something widespread impacted crab numbers at lower levels in the food chain (not from above, like extreme overfishing).

It's within the realm of possibility that the crabs migrated and eluded the expansive surveys. But that currently seems unlikely. For example, a survey in the northern Bering Sea didn't account for the vanished crabs. There aren't clear answers as to where they could have crawled, though NOAA plans to investigate other seafloor areas.

In some "light at the end of the tunnel" news, Fedewa noted that NOAA's intensive surveys discovered new, younger crab "recruits" in their trawling survey gear. These crabs may be five or so years away from leaving their nursery grounds, but this could mean that some of the depleted population could potentially bounce back.

NOAA and other fishery scientists will continue to research what has driven this historic collapse. In total, the estimated mass of male snow crabs that can be legally harvested fell by 44 percent in 2022 (compared to 2021). Tellingly, that's under one-third of the 20-year average, NOAA found. It's a giant biodiversity loss, as well as an economic loss. The Alaskan industry produced some $132 million in snow crab revenue a couple years ago.

"Science points to temperature and bigger picture climate change."

David Gordon Green’s Halloween trilogy spent years carefully unraveling and constructing one of the most brutal beefs in all of entertainment history, between Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) and Michael Myers. Unfortunately, all good things must come to an end — even infamous, part-supernatural, merciless murderers like The Shape. I mean, congrats to Laurie and the folks in Haddonfield for finally ending their nightmare and all, but what about me?! How are fans supposed to go on without the ultimate Final Girl versus the insatiable slasher?

Alas, Halloween Ends — as promised — brings an end to their story...but not without the surprising addition of Corey Cunningham, a new antagonist to complicate the plot and viewers' expectations.

I’ll admit, I felt a twinge of sympathy watching the big, bad Michael Myers struggle throughout the movie, feebly completing his kills while attempting to uphold his reputation as Haddonfield's boogeyman. My sympathy, however, had more to do with his newfound connection with babysitter-turned-slasher Corey Cunningham (Rohan Campbell).

Yet the franchise finale's bold move may have gone too far, as Michael Myers in Halloween Ends felt more like a parody version than the horrific, ravenous monster we've known, with kill sequences to die for. It felt almost illegal to sit in the audience and watch the infamous killer go out as an empathetic mentor/father figure.

Does the death of Michael Myers mean the end of Halloween?

With Michael’s body slashed, stabbed, twisted, and disintegrated by a metal shredder, the likelihood of his return is pretty low (luckily for the survivors of Haddonfield). But slasher lovers may find a silver lining in the death of Michael Myers with the possibility of a continued legacy led by mentee Corey (Boogeyman Jr.?). So: Is Halloween Ends truly the end-all-be-all for Michael's iron grip on the slasher world? Or is this the start of a new chapter?

This might be the time to extend my humblest apologies to the residents in Haddonfield; now may be the perfect time to get familiar with the housing market outside of Illinois.

Corey Cunningham’s introduction to the Halloween franchise begins with a "bang" (sorry, couldn’t help myself) as his innocent babysitter gig turns into a manslaughter case the town won’t forget. His emotional boil over leads to young Roger’s accidental drop of doom over the tall, winding staircase banister, ending all chances of Corey’s promising future as a college-bound aspiring engineer. With his dreams dashed and no chance at assimilating back into Haddonfield's social scene, the town's pariah is pointed toward the darkest hole that exists, and it leads to the hands of Michael Myers.

Could Corey Cunningham be the new Michael Myers?

Unconscious and in reach of The Shape's secret subterranean lair, Corey should have been another easy slaughter for the iconic slasher. Yet he was set free with all of his hairs still in place, a shocking surprise from the violent murderer who finds joy in torturing the innocent. Instead of praise-dancing in light of receiving a new and statistically improbable chance at life, Corey finds himself intrigued by Myers’ choice. So, willingly, he goes back to learn more.

Along with the odd pairing of the town's two most shunned, Corey finds solace in Laurie’s company, getting close to her granddaughter, Allyson (Andi Matichak). As if the lives of the two women weren’t hard enough, Corey makes it his mission to terrorize and play mind games with them, steadily driving them apart. Meanwhile, he begins his own Haddonfield reign of terror right under their noses, drawing Michael closer and closer to the object of his desires.

While Halloween Ends reveals Michael Myers as more dedicated to hiding than homicide, Corey as Boogeyman Jr. is ready and eager to pick up the old man’s slack. Along with the utterly mesmerizing shots and optimistic tone of the Halloween costume party dance sequence, this particular scene foreshadows the awakening of Corey’s true nature. As Corey loses himself to the music, dancing alongside the equally amused Allyson, he throws caution to the wind and unmasks himself from his literal costume mask of a scarecrow — and theoretically from the mask that kept himself posing as an unobtrusive introvert instead of the killer he desires to be. His transformation turns the scene from a gorgeous sequence of youthful fun to a foreboding warning that leaves audiences in a frightened hush.

How could the franchise continue beyond Halloween Ends?

In the highly anticipated and exciting finale, Laurie and her granddaughter finally take down Boogeyman and Boogeyman Jr., leaving audiences relieved and rejoicing.

Corey’s first stab at killing Laurie ends when she gains the upper hand. With a desperate attempt to regain a notion of power, he stabs himself in the throat. But while this almost killed the bond between Laurie and Alyson for good, it didn't kill Corey. Shortly thereafter, his murderous mentor deals the final blow, breaking his neck to end his suffering.

The vague open-endedness of Corey's "disposal" felt eerily familiar to Michael and his number of near-death scenes. It raises the question of whether Corey is really dead at all, especially noting the possibility of supernatural elements that lie within the diseased evil. If Michael has risen from the dead before, and from far worse than a neck snap, can we expect a similar resurrection from Corey?

Boogeyman Jr.'s tilt at Myers-level infamy may have seemed short-lived. But it could simply be a new beginning. If the movie’s insinuation of Michael Myers’ evil as a contagious disease reigns true, viewers could anticipate the possibility of a newer and even more horrific slasher to pick up the mask. If not Corey, another might rise who is just as susceptible to the infectious evil perpetuated by Michael Myers. Could Michael's demise lead to the birth of evil-contaminated slashers awaiting to take his place? Or a town filled with multiple supernatural murderers?

A word of advice if I may: David Gordon Green should start looking into support group options for Haddonfield's citizens sooner rather than later!

Halloween Ends is now in theaters and streaming on Peacock.(opens in a new tab)
David Gordon Green’s Halloween trilogy spent years carefully unraveling and constructing one of the most brutal beefs in all of entertainment history, between Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) and Michael Myers. Unfortunately, all good things must come to an end — even infamous, part-supernatural, merciless murderers like The Shape. I mean, congrats to Laurie and the folks in Haddonfield for finally ending their nightmare and all, but what about me?! How are fans supposed to go on without the ultimate Final Girl versus the insatiable slasher?

Alas, Halloween Ends — as promised — brings an end to their story...but not without the surprising addition of Corey Cunningham, a new antagonist to complicate the plot and viewers' expectations.

I’ll admit, I felt a twinge of sympathy watching the big, bad Michael Myers struggle throughout the movie, feebly completing his kills while attempting to uphold his reputation as Haddonfield's boogeyman. My sympathy, however, had more to do with his newfound connection with babysitter-turned-slasher Corey Cunningham (Rohan Campbell).

Yet the franchise finale's bold move may have gone too far, as Michael Myers in Halloween Ends felt more like a parody version than the horrific, ravenous monster we've known, with kill sequences to die for. It felt almost illegal to sit in the audience and watch the infamous killer go out as an empathetic mentor/father figure.

Does the death of Michael Myers mean the end of Halloween?

With Michael’s body slashed, stabbed, twisted, and disintegrated by a metal shredder, the likelihood of his return is pretty low (luckily for the survivors of Haddonfield). But slasher lovers may find a silver lining in the death of Michael Myers with the possibility of a continued legacy led by mentee Corey (Boogeyman Jr.?). So: Is Halloween Ends truly the end-all-be-all for Michael's iron grip on the slasher world? Or is this the start of a new chapter?

This might be the time to extend my humblest apologies to the residents in Haddonfield; now may be the perfect time to get familiar with the housing market outside of Illinois.

Corey Cunningham’s introduction to the Halloween franchise begins with a "bang" (sorry, couldn’t help myself) as his innocent babysitter gig turns into a manslaughter case the town won’t forget. His emotional boil over leads to young Roger’s accidental drop of doom over the tall, winding staircase banister, ending all chances of Corey’s promising future as a college-bound aspiring engineer. With his dreams dashed and no chance at assimilating back into Haddonfield's social scene, the town's pariah is pointed toward the darkest hole that exists, and it leads to the hands of Michael Myers.

Could Corey Cunningham be the new Michael Myers?

Unconscious and in reach of The Shape's secret subterranean lair, Corey should have been another easy slaughter for the iconic slasher. Yet he was set free with all of his hairs still in place, a shocking surprise from the violent murderer who finds joy in torturing the innocent. Instead of praise-dancing in light of receiving a new and statistically improbable chance at life, Corey finds himself intrigued by Myers’ choice. So, willingly, he goes back to learn more.

Along with the odd pairing of the town's two most shunned, Corey finds solace in Laurie’s company, getting close to her granddaughter, Allyson (Andi Matichak). As if the lives of the two women weren’t hard enough, Corey makes it his mission to terrorize and play mind games with them, steadily driving them apart. Meanwhile, he begins his own Haddonfield reign of terror right under their noses, drawing Michael closer and closer to the object of his desires.

While Halloween Ends reveals Michael Myers as more dedicated to hiding than homicide, Corey as Boogeyman Jr. is ready and eager to pick up the old man’s slack. Along with the utterly mesmerizing shots and optimistic tone of the Halloween costume party dance sequence, this particular scene foreshadows the awakening of Corey’s true nature. As Corey loses himself to the music, dancing alongside the equally amused Allyson, he throws caution to the wind and unmasks himself from his literal costume mask of a scarecrow — and theoretically from the mask that kept himself posing as an unobtrusive introvert instead of the killer he desires to be. His transformation turns the scene from a gorgeous sequence of youthful fun to a foreboding warning that leaves audiences in a frightened hush.

How could the franchise continue beyond Halloween Ends?

In the highly anticipated and exciting finale, Laurie and her granddaughter finally take down Boogeyman and Boogeyman Jr., leaving audiences relieved and rejoicing.

Corey’s first stab at killing Laurie ends when she gains the upper hand. With a desperate attempt to regain a notion of power, he stabs himself in the throat. But while this almost killed the bond between Laurie and Alyson for good, it didn't kill Corey. Shortly thereafter, his murderous mentor deals the final blow, breaking his neck to end his suffering.

The vague open-endedness of Corey's "disposal" felt eerily familiar to Michael and his number of near-death scenes. It raises the question of whether Corey is really dead at all, especially noting the possibility of supernatural elements that lie within the diseased evil. If Michael has risen from the dead before, and from far worse than a neck snap, can we expect a similar resurrection from Corey?

Boogeyman Jr.'s tilt at Myers-level infamy may have seemed short-lived. But it could simply be a new beginning. If the movie’s insinuation of Michael Myers’ evil as a contagious disease reigns true, viewers could anticipate the possibility of a newer and even more horrific slasher to pick up the mask.

So, you say you don’t like Horror Movies(tm), do ya? The gruesome sight of Jason Voorhees hacking off camper’s heads gets a firm “No, thank you!” from you, does it? Michael Myers knocks on your door on October 31st, and you push him off like a wayward Bible salesman, huh?

Well, you don’t have to be left out of the greatest time of year just because you’re not a gorehound. Horror is one of the most stretchily adaptable of genres — there are horror comedies, horror musicals, and even horror for the whole fam. So, if you’re hunting for a festive Halloweenie feeling or two to help you celebrate the season, you don’t have to submit yourself to Eli Roth’s most twisted visions. There are hundreds of choice options to choose from if you prefer spooky to scary, and we whittled it down to the best of the best. Grab your favorite treats, and get ready for some gentle tricks!

Here are our picks for the best streaming horror movies for folks who don’t like horror movies — or so they think!

1. Hocus Pocus

Credit: Disney/Kobal/Shutterstock

The infamously wicked witches of Salem, Massachusetts, known as the Sanderson sisters — Winifred (Bette Midler), Sarah (Sarah Jessica Parker), and Mary (Kathy Najimy) — are on the hunt for fresh souls to regain their youth, and witchy hijinks ensue. Cheesy as it may be, this one might be strictly for those people who grew up with it, and for those who want their little ones to do the same. But the cult of '90s kids around this movie is very real and very intense, and there’s nothing much scarier here than Bette Midler’s Bugs Bunny chompers. So hop on your vacuums and cackle away, you maggoty malfeasances!

And if you’re in the mood for a double feature, well, Hocus Pocus 2 just debuted on Disney+ , just a newt’s-eye short of 30 years after the first film us over. All the better to keep your Billy Butcherson’s (Doug Jones) straight from your Binx the Cats, wouldn’t you say?

2. Monster House

This list could very nearly consist of only animated films, as they more often manage to stay a whisper on the safe side of the gap between Scary and Too-Scary than their live-action compatriots do. But I’ve restricted myself to only two animated movies for this list, and director Gil Kenan’s trick-and-treating rollercoaster ride from 2006 clearly had to be one of them.

Written by the folks who brought you The Sarah Silverman Program and Community, Monster House is clever like those shows and funny like those shows, but it’s also a nonstop, gee-whiz, sugared-up imagination explosion. Beginning with a brilliantly simple conceit, “What if the haunted house was itself the monster?” their script then works to find a dozen ways to spin that off into brilliant little directions — “And what if the house had a uvula?!?” being my personal favorite. And then they hired Maggie Gyllenhaal, Fred Willard, Catherine O’Hara, and best-of-the-best Steve Buscemi to do the voiceover work? Classic.

3. Beetlejuice

If you want to be just mildly spooked, you can't go wrong with any Tim Burton movie; even his Batman movies feel like Halloween freak shows more than they do summer blockbusters.

From the stop-motion sandworms of Mars to that moment when Geena Davis flicks her eyeballs down into her throat, Beetlejuice is filled with oogie boogies of the giggly sort as it plots out what nonsense happens after we die — which in Burton’s hands is mostly the same nonsense we went through during life, only twenty degrees wackier. Show up for Michael Keaton’s single greatest film performance, and leave with Harry Belafonte stuck in your head. It's heaven.

4. ParaNorman

The stop-motion animators at Laika can do no wrong, so nearly any of their fantastic films could have made this list. Some might’ve gone with the Neil Gaiman adaptation of Coraline (and that’s also streaming one on Roku (opens in a new tab)). However, directors Chris Butler and Sam Fell’s ParaNorman is a perfectly realized little wonderment about a little boy who not only sees dead people but idly chats with them too.

By spinning a spooky story about a town’s terrible past as the site of witch trials and its enduring legacy, ParaNorman balances heart and horror — and may gently jerk a few tears from your eyes along the way. No doubt the voice-casting of the incredibly talented Kodi Smit-McPhee as Norman a dozen years before he’d wrassle with Bronco Henry’s protegee had something to do with that, but ParaNorman is chock-full of prescience on every front, including its message about the dangers of mob justice.

5. House on Haunted Hill

Like with Tim Burton’s filmography, you really can’t go wrong with any Vincent Price feature for the nimblest of spooks. Really, you should just watch any and every Vincent Price movie! But William Castle’s 1959 skeleton-in-the-box classic is probably the simplest and most straightforwardly fun of the bunch, using the time-honored tradition of getting a bunch of random people trapped inside of a haunted house together and then just slowly having things pop out at them, one howling sheet after another.

Here, Price plays the devilish millionaire Frederick Loren, who invites a group of strangers to his wife’s birthday party inside said haunted house, promising them each $10,000 if they can last the night. The bodies start piling up, but said corpses are regular skeletons that can't compete with the metaphorical ones jumping out of every character’s closet, including Frederick and his wife Annabelle (Carol Ohmart), who plainly hate each other’s guts to hell and back. It’s a blast! (The 1999 remake is great, but it’s genuinely frightening — so maybe save it for a sunny summer day(opens in a new tab).)

6. The Old Dark House

Credit: Universal/Kobal/Shutterstock

Like House on Haunted Hill, this is another bump-in-the-night flick about a group of disparate folks trapped inside a cobwebby house during a raging storm. But this film directed by James Whale is the haunted house template; everything after is just ripping it shamelessly off.

House has some choice cast members in common with Bride of Frankenstein, another stone cold horror-comedy classic from Whale. First off is Boris Karloff, who plays another sort of "monster" in House — in this case, a rampaging pervert named Morgan who keeps trying to drag the women off, which includes actress Gloria Stuart 65 full years before she oopsied that “Heart of the Ocean” off the side of that little schooner known as Titanic. But, best of all is queer horror icon Ernest Thesiger, who shows up in The Old Dark House to make lisping mincemeat out of lines such as “Have a potato,” and it is he who is my truest everything.

7. Little Shop of Horrors

While Roger Corman’s original 1960 version of Little Shop is great, Frank Oz’s 1986 adaptation of the off-Broadway musical by Alan Menken and Howard Ashman based on Corman’s flick is far more fun, creating not only an epic movie monster but also an entire generation looking for ”Somewhere That’s Green.”

There will never be movie-casting as fine as Rick Moranis as the schlubby plant shop owner and orphan Seymour Krelborn, alongside the legend, the icon, the queen of stage and screen Miss Ellen Greene as Audrey, his intended paramour. When that “mean green mother from outer space,” the blood-hungry plant Audrey II, beams down and wreaks havoc on the unsuspecting denizens of Skid Row, there’s plenty of scary to be had — ax murders and a trip to a sadistic dentist played by Steve Martin chief among them.

But mostly it’s just one perfect song followed by another, and two of the great romantic leads of our age batting eyelashes at one another over trays of frozen TV dinners. Then, on top of all that, there’s a massive, man-eating puppet who's got otherworldly charisma courtesy of the late, great Levi Stubbs, lead singer of the Four Tops. What more could you pine for?

8. Young Frankenstein

It’s alive! ALIVE!!! We didn’t want this list to be nothing but horror-comedies, but how can you not include the greatest one of those of all? (If we’re not counting Evil Dead II anyway, and you non-horror people are going to want to stay far away from Evil Dead II.) Not that there’s anything much scary at all in Mel Brooks’s 1974 spoof of the classic Universal monster movie Frankenstein, but it’s about horror enough that it’s earned its spot on this list. It’s also arguably Mel Brooks’ funniest movie; we dare you to watch Peter Boyle’s Monster “sing” his part of “Puttin’ on the Ritz” with a straight face.

With a cast that includes certifiable comedy legends like Boyle, Gene Wilder, Cloris Leachman, Marty Feldman, Gene Hackman, Teri Garr, and the one and the only Madeline Kahn, there’s not a pair of poo-poo undies in the bunch. [Horses whinny.]

9. Paperhouse

Four years before director Bernard Rose made the very scary Clive Barker adaptation Candyman, he made a small surreal British masterpiece called Paperhouse. Starring a young actress named Charlotte Burke in her only acting gig, the movie tells the story of Anna, a little girl who gets sick from falling asleep outdoors and begins hallucinating a friendship with the little boy who lives inside of her drawings. Everything Anna draws in the pictures comes to life when she ventures inside of them. This turns out to be as thrilling — free popcorn machines and bicycles! — as it can be terrifying, like how her drawing of Marc (Elliott Spiers) as just a sad face in a window leaves him with legs that don’t work. Co-starring the great Glenne Headly as Anna’s mom and Ben Cross (aka Barnabas Collins in the ‘90s Dark Shadows reboot) as her absentee father, Paperhouse has a couple of genuine scares that burned themselves into my brain as a child. But mostly it’s a gothic mood piece that’s the perfect stuff for a cold and windy October afternoon.

10. Return to Oz

Credit: Buena Vista/Kobal/Shutterstock

The scariest movie on this whole list isn’t really supposed to be a horror movie at all! But you tell that to the entire generation of now-adults whose entire bodies collapse onto the floor at the mere whisper of… the Wheelers.

That’s not exactly unique for this property. Before Return to Oz, the Flying Monkeys tore the Scarecrow to shreds and generations had to sleep with the lights on, after all. But in 1985, when director Walter Murch’s sequel to the 1939 masterpiece The Wizard of Oz was released, Return to Oz was mostly scoffed at by critics and audiences alike, dropping like a stone at the box office. Yet something funny happened along the Yellow Brick Road’s dark new branch, and the film’s cast of freaky figures drawn from L. Frank Baum’s Oz books — Gump, Jack Pumpkinhead, Tik-Tok, and the shudder-inducing Princess Mombi with her closet of detachable heads — wormed their way into our collective consciousness. Justice for Fairuza Balk’s Dorothy Gale!

Ready or not, October is upon us!

The year has flown by like a witch on a broomstick (or vacuum, if you're a Hocus Pocus fan). But you better believe it's time to embrace the season of scary. Think pumpkins at the front door, a 12-foot skeleton in the front yard, a haunted house-themed Zoom background, and, of course, something appropriately seasonal cued up on your TV.

To get your Halloween mood on, we've combed through Netflix's catalog and selected 13 of the best spooky movies and TV shows to stream right now. These aren't exclusively horror movies (though we do have a best horror movies on Netflix list for that), but rather a collection of titles specifically geared toward holiday festivities. Happy haunting!

1. Goosebumps

Whether you love R.L. Stine or blame him for your lifelong night terrors (guilty), Goosebumps is the perfect pick for a little hair-raising nostalgia. Evil puppets, creepy piano teachers, mud men, and more abound in this '90s series I still cannot believe was marketed toward children. Here's looking at that reboot, whenever it gets here. Please be just a little less terrifying. Please. —Alison Foreman, Entertainment Reporter

2. Chilling Adventures of Sabrina

Netflix's Riverdale spin-off centered on Sabrina the Teenage Witch — as portrayed by Mad Men's Kiernan Shipka — never quite took flight as we'd hoped. Still, you can't ask for a better spooky show to throw on in the background. The costuming is great. The music is fun, and the plot — while complex — is entertaining enough that popping in and out of it shouldn't bother you much. Plus, there's Salem the cat. No one can say no to a magic cat. — A.F.

3. Gerald's Game

There are number of Stephen King adaptations now streaming on Netflix, including 1922(opens in a new tab), In the Tall Grass, and Mr. Harrigan's Phone. But our favorite has to be Gerald's Game. Starring Carla Gugino and Bruce Greenwood, this horrifying story of a couple seeking alone time is a totally engrossing (and spectacularly feminist) outing unlike any other in the genre. Good luck with..."that" scene. You'll know it when you see it. — A.F.

4. The Midnight Club

Mike Flanagan does it again — this time breaking the Guinness World Record for the most jump scares in a TV episode! If you’re in the mood for a coming-of-age thriller crossover experience, The Midnight Club is worthy of a binge-watch for the Halloween weekend. Given just how scary some of Flanagan's previous projects are (The Haunting of Hill House and Midnight Mass, for instance), we wouldn’t watch this one in the dark. —Kyle McWilliams, Entertainment Intern

5. Old People

Were you procrastinating on calling your grandmother back? This German film should have you hitting speed dial. Ella (Melika Foroutan) and her two children return to Ella's hometown for her sister's wedding, but what should have been an idyllic trip turns into something far more gruesome. For starters, the retirement home Ella's father is in is pretty grim. Plus, there's a creepy relic in the woods. Soon enough — and this isn't a spoiler, this is the whole dang point of the movie — the elderly folks everyone wrote off and forgot about are on a murderous rampage. —K.M.

6. Hush

The home-invasion thriller comes back in style with Hush, which was directed and co-written by Mike Flanagan. Kate Siegel, who co-wrote the script, stars as Maddie, a horror writer who is unable to speak or hear; her solo writing retreat in the woods goes horribly awry when a terrifying masked man (John Gallagher Jr.) begins tormenting her. Keep your eyes peeled for a cool Midnight Mass Easter egg! —K.M.

7. All of Us Are Dead

The zombie apocalypse gets the K-drama treatment in this addictive series about a viral outbreak at a high school, pitting freshly turned zombies against teens and school teachers. The show also addresses (with some controversy) regular high school problems like bullying and being let down by the adults around you. The Season 1 finale will leave you ugly crying, though thankfully a second season is already in the works for this easy-to-root-for cast. —K.M.

8. Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2022)

Following in the footsteps of the 1974 original, this over-the-top sequel gives Leatherface a chance to terrorize a group of millennials hellbent on gentrifying a Texas ghost town. While critics and fans alike were pretty hard on the flick — though appreciative of the spectacular gore Leatherface's antics produced — there are already rumors of sequels on the horizon. If you're looking for spooky vibes, TCM 2022 has plenty to spare. —K.M.

9. CAM

Daniel Goldhaber's CAM isn't really that Halloween-y, but what's the harm in reminding you about this hidden gem while we're here? Starring the always-awesome Madeline Brewer, this psychological thriller brings body-snatching terror to the world of professional cam modeling. It's so good and so underrated. You're welcome in advance! —A.F.

Sure, binging Stranger Things can feel like more of a summer thing, considering that's when we last got a season. But there's no reason Netflix's beloved sci-fi series can't help get you pumped for fall. Season 2 has an especially great Halloween-themed episode worth enjoying as part of a marathon or on its own. You know you want to see those little Ghostbusters again. — A.F.

11. The Walking Dead

Solidifying itself at the top of my gross-but-good list, The Walking Dead has something for everyone: There's the horrific zombie apocalypse, complicated romantic subplots, and then the Steven Yeun, of course. There’s a reason why everyone raves about the series, which definitely lives up to the hype of its 11-season run. —K.M.

An updated but still horrifying take on Shirley Jackson's 1959 novel of the same name, The Haunting of Hill House is an atmospheric nightmare as binge-worthy as it is heartbreaking. Following a family struggling with all kinds of trauma, the ghosts in the background aren't even the spookiest bits. Filled with powerful performances, eerie set pieces, and twists that'll knock your neck out of whack, this series firmly planted Mike Flanagan as Netflix's resident horror master. —Kristy Puchko, Film Editor

13. It

The amount of times you could find the Pennywise dance GIF from my 2017 Twitter feed would probably horrify you more than the movie itself. Nevertheless, It, based on the Stephen King novel, brings book lovers an ultimately unsettling visual narrative that leaves audiences in awe every time. Featuring Pennywise, the sinister dancing clown himself, and a group of ragtag kids you can’t help but root for, this scary movie satisfies all the horror-hunger appetites October brings! —K.M.

Ready or not, October is upon us!

The year has flown by like a witch on a broomstick (or vacuum, if you're a Hocus Pocus fan). But you better believe it's time to embrace the season of scary. Think pumpkins at the front door, a 12-foot skeleton in the front yard, a haunted house-themed Zoom background, and, of course, something appropriately seasonal cued up on your TV.

To get your Halloween mood on, we've combed through Netflix's catalog and selected 13 of the best spooky movies and TV shows to stream right now. These aren't exclusively horror movies (though we do have a best horror movies on Netflix list for that), but rather a collection of titles specifically geared toward holiday festivities. Happy haunting!

1. Goosebumps

Whether you love R.L. Stine or blame him for your lifelong night terrors (guilty), Goosebumps is the perfect pick for a little hair-raising nostalgia. Evil puppets, creepy piano teachers, mud men, and more abound in this '90s series I still cannot believe was marketed toward children. Here's looking at that reboot, whenever it gets here. Please be just a little less terrifying. Please. —Alison Foreman, Entertainment Reporter

2. Chilling Adventures of Sabrina

Netflix's Riverdale spin-off centered on Sabrina the Teenage Witch — as portrayed by Mad Men's Kiernan Shipka — never quite took flight as we'd hoped. Still, you can't ask for a better spooky show to throw on in the background. The costuming is great. The music is fun, and the plot — while complex — is entertaining enough that popping in and out of it shouldn't bother you much. Plus, there's Salem the cat. No one can say no to a magic cat. — A.F.

3. Gerald's Game

There are number of Stephen King adaptations now streaming on Netflix, including 1922(opens in a new tab), In the Tall Grass, and Mr. Harrigan's Phone. But our favorite has to be Gerald's Game. Starring Carla Gugino and Bruce Greenwood, this horrifying story of a couple seeking alone time is a totally engrossing (and spectacularly feminist) outing unlike any other in the genre. Good luck with..."that" scene. You'll know it when you see it. — A.F.

If Quordle is a little too challenging today, you've come to the right place for hints. There aren't just hints here, but the whole Quordle solution. Scroll to the bottom of this page, and there it is. But are you sure you need all four answers? Maybe you just need a strategy guide. Either way, scroll down, and you'll get what you need.

What is Quordle?

Quordle is a five-letter word guessing game similar to Wordle, except each guess applies letters to four words at the same time. You get nine guesses instead of six to correctly guess all four words. It looks like playing four Wordle games at the same time, and that is essentially what it is. But it's not nearly as intimidating as it sounds.

Is Quordle harder than Wordle?

Yes, though not diabolically so.

Where did Quordle come from?

Amid the Wordle boom of late 2021 and early 2022, when everyone was learning to love free, in-browser, once-a-day word guessing games, creator Freddie Meyer says he took inspiration from one of the first big Wordle variations, Dordle — the one where you essentially play two Wordles at once. He took things up a notch, and released Quordle on January 30. Meyer's creation was covered in The Guardian six days later, and now, according to Meyer, it attracts millions of daily users. Today, Meyer earns modest revenue from Patreon, where dedicated Quordle fans can donate to keep their favorite puzzle game running.

How is Quordle pronounced?

“Kwordle.” It should rhyme with “Wordle,” and definitely should not be pronounced exactly like "curdle.”

Is Quordle strategy different from Wordle?

Yes and no.

Your starting strategy should be the same as with Wordle. In fact, if you have a favorite Wordle opening word, there’s no reason to change that here. We suggest something rich in vowels, featuring common letters like C, R, and N. But you do you.

After your first guess, however, you’ll notice things getting out of control if you play Quordle exactly like Wordle.

What should I do in Quordle that I don’t do in Wordle?

Solving a Wordle puzzle can famously come down to a series of single letter-change variations. If you’ve narrowed it down to “-IGHT,” you could guess “MIGHT” “NIGHT” “LIGHT” and “SIGHT” and one of those will probably be the solution — though this is also a famous way to end up losing in Wordle, particularly if you play on “hard mode.” In Quordle, however, this sort of single-letter winnowing is a deadly trap, and it hints at the important strategic difference between Wordle and Quordle: In Quordle, you can't afford to waste guesses unless you're eliminating as many letters as possible at all times.

Guessing a completely random word that you already know isn't the solution, just to eliminate three or four possible letters you haven’t tried yet, is thought of as a desperate, latch-ditch move in Wordle. In Quordle, however, it's a normal part of the player's strategic toolset.

Is there a way to get the answer faster?

In my experience Quordle can be a slow game, sometimes dragging out longer than it would take to play Wordle four times. But a sort of blunt-force guessing approach can speed things up. The following strategy also works with Wordle if you only want the solution, and don’t care about having the fewest possible guesses:

Try starting with a series of words that puts all the vowels (including Y) on the board, along with some other common letters. We've had good luck with the three words: “NOTES,” “ACRID,” and “LUMPY.” YouTuber DougMansLand suggests four words: “CANOE,” “SKIRT,” “PLUMB,” and “FUDGY.”

Most of the alphabet is now eliminated, and you’ll only have the ability to make one or two wrong guesses if you use this strategy. But in most cases you’ll have all the information you need to guess the remaining words without any wrong guesses.

If strategy isn't helping, and you're still stumped, here are some hints:

Are there any double or triple letters in today’s Quordle words?

No.

Are any rare letters being used in today’s Quordle like Q or Z?

That rare and wonderful Q makes an appearance.

What do today’s Quordle words start with?

D, S, Q, and U.

Any other big hints before revealing all four answers?

One of today's words is obscure if you're not a mathematician or a crossword enthusiast.

I'm going to tell you what that unusual word is now:

It's OCTAL.

What are the answers for today’s Quordle?

Are you sure you want to know?

There’s still time to turn back.

OK, you asked for it. The answers are:

It goes without saying, that if you haven't watched the finale of Netflix's The Mole, there's major spoilers and Mole-ish behaviour ahead.

Did you guess it? J'accuuuuuuuse!!!!! The identity of The Mole has finally been revealed after three weeks of yarn-walling it and pointing the finger at every player in the Netflix series.

Briefed by superb host Alex Wagner, the players on The Mole need to work together to complete missions in order to earn cash for a pot only one person can win. That person is the one who correctly guesses the identity of the Mole, a member of the group secretly working to sabotage the missions. After each challenge, the group must answer 20 questions about who they think the imposter is, and the furthest from the truth is sent home.

They've been trapped in jail in Brisbane, searched for crates in the Great Barrier Reef and the Daintree Rainforest, played a giant game of hide and seek across Sydney, and scaled one Australia's of highest peaks. So, who was the Mole this entire time?

Going into the final two episodes we only had five options: software developer Kesi Neblett, commercial pilot Joi Schweitzer, professional gamer Avori Henderson, firefighter Jacob Hacker, and brand manager William Richardson. Essentially, they could all have been the Mole.

After a dramatic finale mission that took over Sydney's Bare Island fort, the Mole was finally revealed. It's Kesi!

Kesi is The Mole! Credit: Netflix

William guessed right and took home $101,500, and sadly Joi was left with only memories.

So, where were the clues? How did Kesi manage to sabotage each mission to reduce the money in the pot?

Episode 1

Kesi plays it cool in the first Daintree mission, letting others take the lead on team selection and genuinely helping Avori retrieve the crate from the trees with William and Dom on the ground, all creating the ruse that she's genuinely there to win that cash.

"First mission, my strategy was to get people to trust me," Kesi says in the finale. "First impressions mean a lot."

Gaining trust. Credit: Netflix

Episode 2

Kesi has an advantage in the jailbreak mission: She'd been there before! Thanks to an earlier briefing in the cell with the producers, Kesi sees her first opportunity for sabotage in the abandoned Boggo Jail. As we pointed out in our lengthy analysis of The Mole , Kesi tells Joi she doesn't see a key outside her own door, but she has the same size door hole as William, who was able to see his key. Joi has a tiny peephole, so she can't see Kesi's key either — it's the perfect cover to stall while throwing the audience off and making Joi look like the Mole. They escape in time, but Kesi costs the team $6,000 in time extensions.

"Of course I saw the key," says Kesi in the finale. "I saw it in the first five minutes of being in the cell, but they didn't need to know that."

Then, whether deliberately or not, Kesi (who is, let's remember, a computer software analyst!) lets other teammates take the lead on the code-cracking in the warehouse mission, then spells one of the passwords wrong typing it into the computer — "neone" instead of "neon" — which takes up an attempt and sets the team locked out for a crucial minute. Kesi's team misses out on the exemptions, and the whole team forfeits $10,000 just for trying to crack the code.

Kesi could have easily smashed this mission. Credit: Netflix

Episode 3

In the Great Barrier Reef treasure hunt, Avori deliberately misses the dinghy on the shore from the helicopter, but Kesi is on the same side of the chopper, so she could have seen it herself and said nothing, using Avori as the perfect cover. And when they're taking the diving equipment out of the dinghy, Kesi makes it look like one of the oxygen tanks is really heavy, stalls slightly, then easily lifts it out of the boat when joined by teammates.

Kesi doesn't look at the dossiers in this episode, because as the Mole, she doesn't need to! And luckily, Joi makes a huge play to drain the pot and secure an exemption card, which draws suspicion from the entire team.

Episode 4

Poor Dom, out there waiting in the car... Credit: Netflix

Kesi is only one of two people (with William) to vote to bring Dom back into the game, an easy way for Kesi to divert suspicion by adding money to the pot. As the Mole, she doesn't really have to worry about going home, so one more player doesn't matter. The group outvotes her, which works in Kesi's favour anyway because they lose $10,000 for ditching Dom.

Kesi should be quite the code-reader given her day job, so when she "failed" to recognise the money-based code in her essential logbook in episode 4's bank heist, eyebrows were raised. Basically, Kesi has the team open almost every single lockbox in the vault except the right ones, and pretends to not have noticed later on in the confrontation.

"My goal was to give them as little help as possible," says Kesi. "Of course I saw the clues: King Midas and Goldilocks. They were so obvious. I read out every other name apart from those. There was no hope."

Greg, Joi, and Will had no hope in this mission. Credit: Netflix

Episode 5

In a seemingly honest mistake, Kesi misses a $2,000 mailbag in the train mission in episode 5, although Greg easily grabs it — twice. But this was no error, people!

"Just a little flick of the wrist, and the money was gone," says Kesi.

"If she's the Mole, that was a good play," Casey says in the episode.

Episode 6

In episode 6, when deciding who should stay behind on the mountaineering challenge in the Blue Mountains, Kesi has full knowledge of who has the money, since she put it there. Kesi says she should stay behind because she faux-predicts the money isn't in her bag. When Avori asks Kesi if she wants to stay behind, she immediately agrees knowing full well she has the money — and successfully costs the team $10,000 before they've even started. Left behind with Greg, Kesi can stay under everyone's radar.

But the biggest move Kesi made in the game? The one that caused players to gasp out loud after deeming her the "most trustworthy" of them all? That exemption card steal in episode 6, when Kesi leaves the team to sleep in a freezing cold, abandoned warehouse, chained to each other at the ankle, and costing the team $20,000 for the pot. Absolutely brutal — and what a savvy play from the Mole to divert suspicion while losing a bunch of cash.

"Surely, only a player would want an exemption bad enough to steal it," says Kesi. Watching the confrontation in the hotel after knowing Kesi is the Mole is even more brutal.

Episode 7

As an interrogator in the Sydney challenge, Kesi tries to get Greg and William to say Avori is lying which would have cost them $20,000; unfortunately for Kesi, she's overruled.

But the biggest clue comes in the elimination round. Greg's number one suspect was Kesi over several episodes. But after his elimination in this episode, after Joi had turned all suspicion on Jacob at the table, Greg told Alex walking out, "I think she got me... I don't know if Joi's the reason that I'm standing out here with you tonight." It appears Greg changed his suspect to Jacob, a devastating fatal switch as he had the Mole right so early in the game.

Episode 8

In episode 8, Joi suspects Kesi after her moves in the hide and seek challenge. Kesi seems to stall while looking for the circling pigeons from the rooftop even when Joi points them out, then later decides a rock-paper-scissors game is the best way to identify the right pigeon. Joi plays this mission too hard for these strategies to work, but they're pretty good tries. When Joi outright accuses Kesi of being the Mole at the table, she doesn't miss a beat deflecting it.

Episode 9

In the Snowy Mountains mission, which required contestants to haul literal blocks of ice cold cash up one of Australia's highest mountains, Kesi hits peak Mole behaviour right out in the open by diabolically tossing cubes of cash right off the sled and dumping them in the snow.

"In the ultimate double bluff, I threw ice blocks off the pulk. No one would believe the Mole would be that obvious."

"In the Snowy Mountains, it was time to switch from defense to offense," says Kesi. "In the ultimate double bluff, I threw ice blocks off the pulk. No one would believe the Mole would be that obvious."

Episode 10

Last chance to sabotage! In the finale fort mission, Kesi chooses to use just one suction cup to traverse the wall to get to the money, then "accidentally" slips and falls. But later she diverts suspicion by catching the last canister of cash.

"Sometimes the best spy, the best double agent, is the one that's right in front of your face," she says.

So, there you go, every move Kesi made to take money out of the pot and sabotage the missions — extremely well played. We take our hat off to "the most charmingly duplicitous person any of us has ever met," as host Alex Wagner says.

The Mole is now streaming on Netflix.(opens in a new tab)
It goes without saying, that if you haven't watched the finale of Netflix's The Mole, there's major spoilers and Mole-ish behaviour ahead.

Did you guess it? J'accuuuuuuuse!!!!! The identity of The Mole has finally been revealed after three weeks of yarn-walling it and pointing the finger at every player in the Netflix series.

Briefed by superb host Alex Wagner, the players on The Mole need to work together to complete missions in order to earn cash for a pot only one person can win. That person is the one who correctly guesses the identity of the Mole, a member of the group secretly working to sabotage the missions. After each challenge, the group must answer 20 questions about who they think the imposter is, and the furthest from the truth is sent home.

They've been trapped in jail in Brisbane, searched for crates in the Great Barrier Reef and the Daintree Rainforest, played a giant game of hide and seek across Sydney, and scaled one Australia's of highest peaks. So, who was the Mole this entire time?

Going into the final two episodes we only had five options: software developer Kesi Neblett, commercial pilot Joi Schweitzer, professional gamer Avori Henderson, firefighter Jacob Hacker, and brand manager William Richardson. Essentially, they could all have been the Mole.

After a dramatic finale mission that took over Sydney's Bare Island fort, the Mole was finally revealed. It's Kesi!

William guessed right and took home $101,500, and sadly Joi was left with only memories.

So, where were the clues? How did Kesi manage to sabotage each mission to reduce the money in the pot?

Episode 1

Kesi plays it cool in the first Daintree mission, letting others take the lead on team selection and genuinely helping Avori retrieve the crate from the trees with William and Dom on the ground, all creating the ruse that she's genuinely there to win that cash.

"First mission, my strategy was to get people to trust me," Kesi says in the finale. "First impressions mean a lot."

Episode 2

Kesi has an advantage in the jailbreak mission: She'd been there before! Thanks to an earlier briefing in the cell with the producers, Kesi sees her first opportunity for sabotage in the abandoned Boggo Jail. As we pointed out in our lengthy analysis of The Mole , Kesi tells Joi she doesn't see a key outside her own door, but she has the same size door hole as William, who was able to see his key. Joi has a tiny peephole, so she can't see Kesi's key either — it's the perfect cover to stall while throwing the audience off and making Joi look like the Mole. They escape in time, but Kesi costs the team $6,000 in time extensions.

"Of course I saw the key," says Kesi in the finale. "I saw it in the first five minutes of being in the cell, but they didn't need to know that."

Then, whether deliberately or not, Kesi (who is, let's remember, a computer software analyst!) lets other teammates take the lead on the code-cracking in the warehouse mission, then spells one of the passwords wrong typing it into the computer — "neone" instead of "neon" — which takes up an attempt and sets the team locked out for a crucial minute. Kesi's team misses out on the exemptions, and the whole team forfeits $10,000 just for trying to crack the code.

Episode 3

In the Great Barrier Reef treasure hunt, Avori deliberately misses the dinghy on the shore from the helicopter, but Kesi is on the same side of the chopper, so she could have seen it herself and said nothing, using Avori as the perfect cover. And when they're taking the diving equipment out of the dinghy, Kesi makes it look like one of the oxygen tanks is really heavy, stalls slightly, then easily lifts it out of the boat when joined by teammates.

Kesi doesn't look at the dossiers in this episode, because as the Mole, she doesn't need to! And luckily, Joi makes a huge play to drain the pot and secure an exemption card, which draws suspicion from the entire team.

Episode 4

Poor Dom, out there waiting in the car... Credit: Netflix

Kesi is only one of two people (with William) to vote to bring Dom back into the game, an easy way for Kesi to divert suspicion by adding money to the pot. As the Mole, she doesn't really have to worry about going home, so one more player doesn't matter. The group outvotes her, which works in Kesi's favour anyway because they lose $10,000 for ditching Dom.

Kesi should be quite the code-reader given her day job, so when she "failed" to recognise the money-based code in her essential logbook in episode 4's bank heist, eyebrows were raised. Basically, Kesi has the team open almost every single lockbox in the vault except the right ones, and pretends to not have noticed later on in the confrontation.

"My goal was to give them as little help as possible," says Kesi. "Of course I saw the clues: King Midas and Goldilocks. They were so obvious. I read out every other name apart from those. There was no hope."

Episode 5

In a seemingly honest mistake, Kesi misses a $2,000 mailbag in the train mission in episode 5, although Greg easily grabs it — twice. But this was no error, people!

"Just a little flick of the wrist, and the money was gone," says Kesi.

"If she's the Mole, that was a good play," Casey says in the episode.

Episode 6

In episode 6, when deciding who should stay behind on the mountaineering challenge in the Blue Mountains, Kesi has full knowledge of who has the money, since she put it there. Kesi says she should stay behind because she faux-predicts the money isn't in her bag. When Avori asks Kesi if she wants to stay behind, she immediately agrees knowing full well she has the money — and successfully costs the team $10,000 before they've even started. Left behind with Greg, Kesi can stay under everyone's radar.

But the biggest move Kesi made in the game? The one that caused players to gasp out loud after deeming her the "most trustworthy" of them all? That exemption card steal in episode 6, when Kesi leaves the team to sleep in a freezing cold, abandoned warehouse, chained to each other at the ankle, and costing the team $20,000 for the pot. Absolutely brutal — and what a savvy play from the Mole to divert suspicion while losing a bunch of cash.

"Surely, only a player would want an exemption bad enough to steal it," says Kesi. Watching the confrontation in the hotel after knowing Kesi is the Mole is even more brutal.

Episode 7

As an interrogator in the Sydney challenge, Kesi tries to get Greg and William to say Avori is lying which would have cost them $20,000; unfortunately for Kesi, she's overruled.

But the biggest clue comes in the elimination round. Greg's number one suspect was Kesi over several episodes. But after his elimination in this episode, after Joi had turned all suspicion on Jacob at the table, Greg told Alex walking out, "I think she got me... I don't know if Joi's the reason that I'm standing out here with you tonight." It appears Greg changed his suspect to Jacob, a devastating fatal switch as he had the Mole right so early in the game.

Episode 8

In episode 8, Joi suspects Kesi after her moves in the hide and seek challenge. Kesi seems to stall while looking for the circling pigeons from the rooftop even when Joi points them out, then later decides a rock-paper-scissors game is the best way to identify the right pigeon. Joi plays this mission too hard for these strategies to work, but they're pretty good tries. When Joi outright accuses Kesi of being the Mole at the table, she doesn't miss a beat deflecting it.

Episode 9

In the Snowy Mountains mission, which required contestants to haul literal blocks of ice cold cash up one of Australia's highest mountains, Kesi hits peak Mole behaviour right out in the open by diabolically tossing cubes of cash right off the sled and dumping them in the snow.

"In the ultimate double bluff, I threw ice blocks off the pulk. No one would believe the Mole would be that obvious."

"In the Snowy Mountains, it was time to switch from defense to offense," says Kesi. "In the ultimate double bluff, I threw ice blocks off the pulk. No one would believe the Mole would be that obvious."

Episode 10

Last chance to sabotage! In the finale fort mission, Kesi chooses to use just one suction cup to traverse the wall to get to the money, then "accidentally" slips and falls. But later she diverts suspicion by catching the last canister of cash.

"Sometimes the best spy, the best double agent, is the one that's right in front of your face," she says.

So, there you go, every move Kesi made to take money out of the pot and sabotage the missions — extremely well played. We take our hat off to "the most charmingly duplicitous person any of us has ever met," as host Alex Wagner says.

It's finally the weekend, but the new Taylor Swift album isn't the only thing on our minds: there's also a fresh Wordle! If you're staring at a black space, though, we've got some clues and the solution, as we do every day.

If you just want today's word, you can jump straight to the end of this article for October 22's Wordle solution, for puzzle #490. If you'd rather work through it yourself, keep reading for some tips, tricks, and clues.

Where did Wordle come from?

Wordle was initially created by engineer Josh Wardle as a gift for his partner, though it quickly spread until it became an international phenomenon. Thousands of players across the globe tackle Wordle each day, with some fans even having created alternate versions of the daily word puzzle game. These include battle royale format Squabble, music identification game Heardle, and variations like Dordle and Quordle that make you guess multiple words at once.

The popularity of Wordle even reached such heights that the New York Times bought it earlier this year, while TikTok creators live-stream themselves playing it.

What's the best Wordle starting word?

The goal of Wordle is to have fun, and there's no right way to have fun. Just choose whatever starting word feels right to you, and don't let anyone shame you for it. However, if you want to take a more strategic approach, we have a few ideas to help you pick a word that will spark joy. One tip is to select a word that includes at least two different vowels, plus some common consonants like S, T, R, or N.

What happened to the Wordle archive?

The entire archive of past Wordles used to be available for anyone to play in glorious days gone by. Unfortunately it has since been taken down, with the website's creator stating it was done at the request of the New York Times.

Is Wordle getting harder?

If you're finding Wordle too easy, you can try enabling its Hard Mode to give your brain a tougher challenge. But Wordle isn't getting any harder by itself — it's the same difficulty that it's always been.

Why are there two different Wordle answers some days?

Wordle is a fun, collective experience specifically because everyone's solving for the same word every day. Occasionally, though, Wordle has accepted two different solutions as correct on the same day. This is because the New York Times made changes to the Wordle word list after acquiring it, and sometimes swaps out words from the original list. To ensure you're getting the right answer every day, refresh your browser before you play — the site will save your streak.

Here's a subtle hint for today's Wordle answer:

You have to say it out loud, but really try to sell it.

It does not!

Today's Wordle is a 5-letter word that starts with...

Facebook and TikTok failed to block paid advertisements spreading misinformation about voting in the 2022 midterm elections, according to a new report from the human rights non-profit Global Witness and the Cybersecurity for Democracy (C4D) Team at New York University.

For its test, Global Witness created dummy accounts on Facebook, TikTok, and YouTube and attempted to run ten identical advertisements on each platform in both English and Spanish. Each ad contained "outright false and misleading election misinformation." These ads contained falsehoods such as telling voters they needed to be vaccinated to vote in person or that voters would need to vote twice so that their votes would count. Other ads simply provided the wrong date for people to vote. The ads targeted voters in Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania – all battleground states. Global Witness then went through the process involved in running this misinformation through each company's official ad platform.

All of the submitted advertisements were in violation of all three platforms' policies.

Yet, YouTube was the only platform to block all of these misinformation-spreading ads. Furthermore, YouTube was also the only platform that blocked the accounts that attempted to run the ads.

"For years we have seen key democratic processes undermined by disinformation, lies and hate being spread on social media platforms – the companies themselves even claim to recognise the problem," said Global Witness Senior Advisor Jon Lloyd in a statement . "But this research shows they are still simply not doing enough to stop threats to democracy surfacing on their platforms.”

"YouTube’s performance in our experiment demonstrates that detecting damaging election disinformation isn’t impossible," C4D co-director Damon McCoy said. "But all the platforms we studied should have gotten an 'A' on this assignment."

According to Global Witness and C4D, Facebook approved 20 percent of these ads in English and 50 percent of the ads in Spanish during one test. Another Facebook ad test that was conducted saw 30 percent of the English ads and 20 percent of the Spanish ads approved. One alarming issue with the latter test, however, was that they were submitted from a dummy account based in the United Kingdom, meaning that the account should not have been able to run political ads in the U.S. at all.

Facebook also only deleted one out of the three dummy accounts used to run the misinformation ads.

In a statement provided to researchers, Facebook said "these reports were based on a very small sample of ads, and are not representative given the number of political ads we review daily across the world."

But, Facebook did not fare the worst in this experiment. That designation goes to TikTok.

Unlike YouTube or Facebook, the viral short form video platform doesn't even allow political advertising on its platform. Yet, TikTok approved 90 percent of the ads featuring voting misinformation. The only ads it rejected were the ones claiming a COVID vaccine was necessary to vote.

In a statement provided to researchers, a TikTok spokesperson said that the platform "is a place for authentic and entertaining content which is why we prohibit and remove election misinformation and paid political advertising from our platform."

However, the TikTok account used to submit the voting misinformation ads was not removed until the researchers reached out to the company.

It should be noted that none of these ads were actually shown to users on any of these platforms as researchers removed the ads without running them after they were approved.

It's been well-established that social media platforms have increasingly become weaponized to spread election misinformation. Foreign actors spreading falsehoods on social networks like Facebook about elections in the U.S. was a major story in 2016. And going into 2020, election fraud misinformation ramped up even further on these platforms, alongside the spread of COVID conspiracy theories and dangerous movements like QAnon .

TikTok has grown and matured exponentially since just two years ago and it brings new misinformation problems to the social media mix. Online election misinformation has the ability to create some real-world problems. Just this past week, for example, election fraud conspiracy theorists were staking out ballot drop boxes in order to intimidate voters.

And while Facebook and YouTube have certainly taken action since those election cycles, it's clearly not enough.

The 2022 midterm elections are just weeks away, on Tuesday, Nov. 8. That doesn't leave much time for social media platforms to get their acts together. But it certainly is plenty of time for misinformation to spread.

It’s been a long, two-month promotional cycle, but Taylor Swift's Midnights is officially here. While the pop star tried every social media and corporate tactic to build anticipation and participation in the album release, something about the Midnights era just felt off. It left some diehard Swifties wanting more.

Swift is consistently setting new standards for album rollouts and social media engagement across the music industry. In her early career days, she was establishing close bonds with fans through Tumblr conversations and secret listening parties . She took the internet by surprise after ceremoniously cleansing her Instagram and rebranding her account ahead of Reputation’s release. The surprise drop of her folk-era albums Folklore and Evermore won her a Grammy and internet prestige. And by re-recording and releasing her early albums to gain complete ownership of her catalog, she’s setting a precedent for other artists to follow. In many ways, Taylor Swift is the blueprint when it comes to building a successful and long-lasting career. So what felt different about the rollout of Midnights?

It used to be easier to reach fans on social media through different fandom spaces. Now, these online communities are a more complex ecosystem, with TikTok, Discord, Reddit, Twitter, and even Tumblr all having their place — making it more challenging for artists who connect with fans online, like Swift, to have effective, authentic social media campaigns without spreading themselves too thin.

As a music and fandom tastemaker, Swift seems to now be struggling with where to go next — and the rest of us are reflecting on the ways her choices have impacted other artists.

Mashable reporters Elena Cavender and Chase DiBenedetto, two lifelong fangirls, dive into the world of Midnights and celebrity branding.

Midnights Mayhem? No way. Bedtime is at 10 p.m.

Chase: We have to say it. We didn't like the pre-album cycle. Something about it was off. She was doing too many things, and even though I appreciate that she didn't rely on her tried and true Easter eggs (which was actually not the case at all), it all still felt half-baked. She had collaborations with every major company: TikTok, Spotify, Tumblr, and Amazon Prime Video. Not to mention, a dozen variants of her album on vinyl, exclusive signed art cards only available at midnight on certain days, and the classic new era merch.

Elena: I am a lifelong Taylor Swift fan, and me and my fellow IRL Swifties all agree that the Midnights promo feels like a return to Taylor Swift™. With all of Swift's platform partnerships and cross-posting it was hard to keep up with her promo and know where to look.

While the promo for Red (Taylor's Version) was also TikTok heavy, there was something really endearing about it. Swift tapped into our collective nostalgia, and it felt like more people were on her side in her fight for ownership over her first six albums. I honestly can't remember an album release that had my corner of social media more excited. With the Midnights release the sentiment in my circles is "c'mon Taylor, you want us to watch Thursday night football? Gimme a break."

Chase: You're right. The Red (Taylor's Version) release felt like the perfect combination of all of her marketing strategies with an added benefit of nostalgia. It appealed to everyone I think, not even just Swift fans. I even had old highschool friends messaging me about our first listen to the original version.

Elena: But even with Red (Taylor’s Version), she tried to get "Nothing New" (the heart-wrenching track about aging featuring Phoebe Bridgers) trending on TikTok by posting clips of herself when she’d "had too much to drink" and encouraged fans to do the same. At the same time the song became an organic trend with users posting images of themselves at 17 to the line "the kind of radiance you only have at 17." The fan-created trend had more depth and spoke to fans’ connection with the song. That kind of thing can’t be artificially created by an artist’s marketing team.

She’s aiming to create digital trends again with Midnights, but this time it’s through a partnership with YouTube Shorts. The #TSAntiHeroChallenge is exclusive to YouTube Shorts, and any fan activity being pegged to a brand is immediately a turn off.

Chase: Swift used TikTok a lot to promote the Midnights album, too, even partnering with the app again, but it had an artificial note to it. I loved that she revisited her old Tumblr blogs and cringe millennial posting during the Red (Taylor's Version) release because that felt genuine to the moment and the era. Instead, I didn't feel any motivation to tune into the nightly scripted videos she put on TikTok.

Elena: Totally, her Midnights Mayhem with me videos felt so stilted!

Taylor Swift, girl, Easter eggs are your whole thing!

Chase: Swift has so much power in the music industry to steer trends. She embraced eras, rebrands, Easter eggs, and drama. But instead of leaning into that again, she backed off. This was probably because she wanted to come off as earnest, but I think that's the opposite of what happened.

Elena: Album clues are literally a part of her existence as an artist. She created this monster in terms of fans who now look for Easter eggs in everything she does. So why change her strategy for this release? Taylor, just be yourself. Never change.

The mainstreaming of intense fandom behavior and other artists taking note of Swift’s conspiratorial strategy has inspired everyone to take that approach.

Chase: Ideally, I want other artists to never use Easter eggs, and Swift to lean heavily into them. But the opposite was happening! She has to either fully embrace the fact that she's redefined the industry's marketing tactics and continue feeding into the Swiftie conspiratorial universe, or seriously scale back on the promotion! She doesn't really need it at the end of the day, and half-baked promotion cycles aren't fun.

Elena: The music speaks for itself! As frustrated as I may be by this album’s promotion, ultimately I connect with Swift the songwriter, rather than Swift the brand again.

With the "Midnights Mayhem with Me" series on TikTok, Swift explained the premise of every song on the album, which was a complete 180 from the Folklore and Evermore releases, where we knew nothing. There was almost too much information ahead of the album. It’s nice for artists to give fans the opportunity to interpret a song before traditionally heading to read a magazine profile on their inspiration. Instead, Swift gave us all the information herself weeks ahead of the album, which wasn’t an effective tool to build anticipation and suspense for the album. Those TikToks should have come with a spoiler warning! Though, I do appreciate that there ended up being seven additional songs — that no one knew was coming.

Chase: Her entire brand seems to be relying on a bait and switch with her fans. That would probably backfire with other fanbases, but Swift seems to exist beyond that.

The TikTok-ification of artist branding

Chase: The very obvious elephant in the room that we can't stop mentioning is TikTok. The music industry, and now the broader celebrity economy, is so wedded to the app and its ability to instantly blow up a song, artist, or video. While new artists are being discovered from TikTok covers and original songs, established artists are now implying that the only way to ensure their releases are successful is if they become viral on TikTok. Taylor definitely uses that to her advantage.

Being so attached to TikTok and its algorithm is a dangerous game, but it helps when you also have big brands on your side, as well as collaborations with the company itself and a legion of fans investing in a multiverse of content .

Elena: Midnights brought to you by TikTok™ and Amazon Prime Thursday Night Football.

Chase: Capitalist first, pop star second?

Elena: The current moment on TikTok is weird for artists, too. Obviously, having a trending audio is a signifier of an artist's cultural relevance and leads to streams (and money), which can make an artist's presence on the app feel disingenuous. On the other hand, chances are we’re going to be seeing more and more of this, especially considering TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, filed for a trademark for "TikTok Music," and seems to be constructing its own streaming platform.

"Taylor Swift is the music industry"

Chase: As soon as Swift announced Midnights, Twitter was flooded with tweets about the "Tumblr Renaissance", with people noting that OG artists like Taylor, The 1975, Arctic Monkeys, Tegan and Sara, Death Cab for Cutie, and Carly Rae Jepsen were all coming out with albums this fall, following a year of releases from other Tumblr-era artists like Lorde and Charli XCX. While Easter eggs weren't necessarily part of Tumblr-era music promotion, fandom conspiracies certainly were part of the conversation. Is this where we, as former Directioners, nod to One Direction's "Larry Stylinson?" We simply don't have enough words to go into that.

Elena: We definitely saw the mainstreaming of "Gaylor" conspiracy theories in the way that we saw with Larry years ago.

Chase: The Midnights promotional cycle is serving us the same vibes as the weird Harry's House Easter eggs — which aren't over, by the way! He's still launching mysterious fake businesses to promote his suspected new music video, which is coming out months after the album. It's an advertising strategy he's never used before until this year.

Elena: I still don't know what the doors were about, and I'm a diehard Harry fan! What were those random photos that you could literally reverse image search? Styles and Swift both understand that you need to be engaging fans where they gather, the internet, but both of their album promos missed the mark.

Chase: And we hated the Discord channel he launched. So many artists are branching into Discord in ways that seem to cater to super fan communities who are into theorizing, surprise drops, and other forms of mysterious posting — even emo legends Paramore launched a Discord to go along with an even more mysterious website rebrand ahead of their new album. As a long-time fan of theirs, I don't really understand why they felt the need to do that, unless they are trying to cater to a new (possibly younger or more "online") audience.

Elena: Marketing teams and celebrities know about the popularity of Easter eggs and are just sitting in a room trying to come up with them.

Chase: The music industry on the whole has been contending with a lot of internal upheaval, not to mention a lot of global pop acts that are redefining the fan-artist relationship , and you can see it reflected in how artists use their social media, whether or not their accounts feel like pure promotion or personalized, relatable feeds. You also have new generations, engaging with live music and fan culture for the first time, dictating the success of established artists in new ways like viral TikTok sounds, trending conversations, and ticket sales. Fans have always ruled online, and they rule the music industry, too.

One final "Question…?"

Elena: What are your favorite tracks off the album?

Chase: "Midnight Rain," "Karma," and "Lavender Haze," definitely. I'm a "False God" stan, so I think that all tracks. What about you?

Elena: "Mastermind"... and "Sweet Nothing." Songs about Joe Alwyn have got to be one of my favorite genres.
It’s been a long, two-month promotional cycle, but Taylor Swift's Midnights is officially here. While the pop star tried every social media and corporate tactic to build anticipation and participation in the album release, something about the Midnights era just felt off. It left some diehard Swifties wanting more.

Swift is consistently setting new standards for album rollouts and social media engagement across the music industry. In her early career days, she was establishing close bonds with fans through Tumblr conversations and secret listening parties . She took the internet by surprise after ceremoniously cleansing her Instagram and rebranding her account ahead of Reputation’s release. The surprise drop of her folk-era albums Folklore and Evermore won her a Grammy and internet prestige. And by re-recording and releasing her early albums to gain complete ownership of her catalog, she’s setting a precedent for other artists to follow. In many ways, Taylor Swift is the blueprint when it comes to building a successful and long-lasting career. So what felt different about the rollout of Midnights?

It used to be easier to reach fans on social media through different fandom spaces. Now, these online communities are a more complex ecosystem, with TikTok, Discord, Reddit, Twitter, and even Tumblr all having their place — making it more challenging for artists who connect with fans online, like Swift, to have effective, authentic social media campaigns without spreading themselves too thin.

As a music and fandom tastemaker, Swift seems to now be struggling with where to go next — and the rest of us are reflecting on the ways her choices have impacted other artists.

Mashable reporters Elena Cavender and Chase DiBenedetto, two lifelong fangirls, dive into the world of Midnights and celebrity branding.

Midnights Mayhem? No way. Bedtime is at 10 p.m.

Chase: We have to say it. We didn't like the pre-album cycle. Something about it was off. She was doing too many things, and even though I appreciate that she didn't rely on her tried and true Easter eggs (which was actually not the case at all), it all still felt half-baked. She had collaborations with every major company: TikTok, Spotify, Tumblr, and Amazon Prime Video. Not to mention, a dozen variants of her album on vinyl, exclusive signed art cards only available at midnight on certain days, and the classic new era merch.

Elena: I am a lifelong Taylor Swift fan, and me and my fellow IRL Swifties all agree that the Midnights promo feels like a return to Taylor Swift™. With all of Swift's platform partnerships and cross-posting it was hard to keep up with her promo and know where to look.

While the promo for Red (Taylor's Version) was also TikTok heavy, there was something really endearing about it. Swift tapped into our collective nostalgia, and it felt like more people were on her side in her fight for ownership over her first six albums. I honestly can't remember an album release that had my corner of social media more excited. With the Midnights release the sentiment in my circles is "c'mon Taylor, you want us to watch Thursday night football? Gimme a break."

Chase: You're right. The Red (Taylor's Version) release felt like the perfect combination of all of her marketing strategies with an added benefit of nostalgia. It appealed to everyone I think, not even just Swift fans. I even had old highschool friends messaging me about our first listen to the original version.

Elena: But even with Red (Taylor’s Version), she tried to get "Nothing New" (the heart-wrenching track about aging featuring Phoebe Bridgers) trending on TikTok by posting clips of herself when she’d "had too much to drink" and encouraged fans to do the same. At the same time the song became an organic trend with users posting images of themselves at 17 to the line "the kind of radiance you only have at 17." The fan-created trend had more depth and spoke to fans’ connection with the song. That kind of thing can’t be artificially created by an artist’s marketing team.

She’s aiming to create digital trends again with Midnights, but this time it’s through a partnership with YouTube Shorts. The #TSAntiHeroChallenge is exclusive to YouTube Shorts, and any fan activity being pegged to a brand is immediately a turn off.

Chase: Swift used TikTok a lot to promote the Midnights album, too, even partnering with the app again, but it had an artificial note to it. I loved that she revisited her old Tumblr blogs and cringe millennial posting during the Red (Taylor's Version) release because that felt genuine to the moment and the era. Instead, I didn't feel any motivation to tune into the nightly scripted videos she put on TikTok.

Elena: Totally, her Midnights Mayhem with me videos felt so stilted!

Taylor Swift, girl, Easter eggs are your whole thing!

Chase: Swift has so much power in the music industry to steer trends. She embraced eras, rebrands, Easter eggs, and drama. But instead of leaning into that again, she backed off. This was probably because she wanted to come off as earnest, but I think that's the opposite of what happened.

Elena: Album clues are literally a part of her existence as an artist. She created this monster in terms of fans who now look for Easter eggs in everything she does. So why change her strategy for this release? Taylor, just be yourself. Never change.

The mainstreaming of intense fandom behavior and other artists taking note of Swift’s conspiratorial strategy has inspired everyone to take that approach.

Chase: Ideally, I want other artists to never use Easter eggs, and Swift to lean heavily into them. But the opposite was happening! She has to either fully embrace the fact that she's redefined the industry's marketing tactics and continue feeding into the Swiftie conspiratorial universe, or seriously scale back on the promotion! She doesn't really need it at the end of the day, and half-baked promotion cycles aren't fun.

Elena: The music speaks for itself! As frustrated as I may be by this album’s promotion, ultimately I connect with Swift the songwriter, rather than Swift the brand again.

With the "Midnights Mayhem with Me" series on TikTok, Swift explained the premise of every song on the album, which was a complete 180 from the Folklore and Evermore releases, where we knew nothing. There was almost too much information ahead of the album. It’s nice for artists to give fans the opportunity to interpret a song before traditionally heading to read a magazine profile on their inspiration. Instead, Swift gave us all the information herself weeks ahead of the album, which wasn’t an effective tool to build anticipation and suspense for the album. Those TikToks should have come with a spoiler warning! Though, I do appreciate that there ended up being seven additional songs — that no one knew was coming.

Chase: Her entire brand seems to be relying on a bait and switch with her fans. That would probably backfire with other fanbases, but Swift seems to exist beyond that.

The TikTok-ification of artist branding

Chase: The very obvious elephant in the room that we can't stop mentioning is TikTok. The music industry, and now the broader celebrity economy, is so wedded to the app and its ability to instantly blow up a song, artist, or video. While new artists are being discovered from TikTok covers and original songs, established artists are now implying that the only way to ensure their releases are successful is if they become viral on TikTok. Taylor definitely uses that to her advantage.

Being so attached to TikTok and its algorithm is a dangerous game, but it helps when you also have big brands on your side, as well as collaborations with the company itself and a legion of fans investing in a multiverse of content .

Elena: Midnights brought to you by TikTok™ and Amazon Prime Thursday Night Football.

Chase: Capitalist first, pop star second?

Elena: The current moment on TikTok is weird for artists, too. Obviously, having a trending audio is a signifier of an artist's cultural relevance and leads to streams (and money), which can make an artist's presence on the app feel disingenuous. On the other hand, chances are we’re going to be seeing more and more of this, especially considering TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, filed for a trademark for "TikTok Music," and seems to be constructing its own streaming platform.

"Taylor Swift is the music industry"

Chase: As soon as Swift announced Midnights, Twitter was flooded with tweets about the "Tumblr Renaissance", with people noting that OG artists like Taylor, The 1975, Arctic Monkeys, Tegan and Sara, Death Cab for Cutie, and Carly Rae Jepsen were all coming out with albums this fall, following a year of releases from other Tumblr-era artists like Lorde and Charli XCX. While Easter eggs weren't necessarily part of Tumblr-era music promotion, fandom conspiracies certainly were part of the conversation. Is this where we, as former Directioners, nod to One Direction's "Larry Stylinson?" We simply don't have enough words to go into that.

Elena: We definitely saw the mainstreaming of "Gaylor" conspiracy theories in the way that we saw with Larry years ago.

Chase: The Midnights promotional cycle is serving us the same vibes as the weird Harry's House Easter eggs — which aren't over, by the way! He's still launching mysterious fake businesses to promote his suspected new music video, which is coming out months after the album. It's an advertising strategy he's never used before until this year.

Elena: I still don't know what the doors were about, and I'm a diehard Harry fan! What were those random photos that you could literally reverse image search? Styles and Swift both understand that you need to be engaging fans where they gather, the internet, but both of their album promos missed the mark.

Chase: And we hated the Discord channel he launched. So many artists are branching into Discord in ways that seem to cater to super fan communities who are into theorizing, surprise drops, and other forms of mysterious posting — even emo legends Paramore launched a Discord to go along with an even more mysterious website rebrand ahead of their new album. As a long-time fan of theirs, I don't really understand why they felt the need to do that, unless they are trying to cater to a new (possibly younger or more "online") audience.

Elena: Marketing teams and celebrities know about the popularity of Easter eggs and are just sitting in a room trying to come up with them.

Chase: The music industry on the whole has been contending with a lot of internal upheaval, not to mention a lot of global pop acts that are redefining the fan-artist relationship , and you can see it reflected in how artists use their social media, whether or not their accounts feel like pure promotion or personalized, relatable feeds.

Actor Emma D'Arcy's love for Negroni Sbagliato has taken the internet by storm, and now Google has gotten in on it.

Social media has been abuzz about the drink ever since D'Arcy said it's their drink of choice in a video with fellow House of the Dragon star Olivia Cooke. (They added "with Prosecco in it," which is a bit redundant as the recipe for Negroni Sbagliato already calls for Prosecco, but we'll forgive them.)

Cooke, meanwhile, said her choice drink — besides a Negroni — is a gin martini with a twist.

Google has now turned the viral moment into a cute easter egg. Search "Emma D'Arcy," "Olivia Cooke," or "Negroni Sbagliato" and you'll see an animation of two hands cheersing their drinks — one a Negroni Sbagliato, the other a martini. Given the sleeves, the two are likely depicted as their House of the Dragon characters.

Save 44%: As of Oct. 21, you can grab the 2021 Apple TV 4K (32GB)(opens in a new tab) for just $99.99 at Amazon, saving you $70 off its $179 full price and beating it's previous all-time low by $9.

It's a tale as old as time: a new generation of an Apple product hits the scene, and the old gen Apple product quietly takes a price dive.

This time, Apple took us by surprise by announcing the new Apple TV 4K just a year after the previous generation's release. So though it's by no means outdated, the 2021 Apple TV 4K with 32GB of storage space has dropped to $100(opens in a new tab) at Amazon, from its $179 list price and its previous $109 low. (If you're looking for a slight storage upgrade, the 64GB model(opens in a new tab) is also down to an all-time low).

The Apple TV 4K provides the versatility with tvOS, allowing you to watch shows from your favorite streaming services, play music with Apple Music, or get to sweating with Apple Fitness+, all with a 4K frame rate. It also makes AirPlaying from any Apple device beyond simple, whether that be via your phone, MacBook, or iPad. All this is powered by its A12 Bionic chip, which may not be the latest and greatest, but gets the job done for most streaming purposes (gaming might have some lag, though).

It is worth mentioning that the new Apple TV 4K(opens in a new tab) comes at a starting price lower than its predecessor at just $130 and has 64GB of storage. However, the processor and design upgrades aren't massively groundbreaking, so if you want to save the most you can, you're not sacrificing much by opting for the year-old pick.

Welcome to AirFryDay, where — you guessed it — every Friday Mashable covers the latest trends, dispenses advice, and reviews recipes for your air fryer.

I love a theme party and any excuse to get way too into something relatively meaningless. I fully commit.

So when a family member suggested we have a watch party for the new Halloween movie, I happily undertook creating a scary-good menu. On the dinner list: salad dressed with blood-red vinaigrette, steak and orange habanero salsa, and deep-fried sweet potato fries shaped like pumpkins.

With Halloween inching closer, I thought it'd be smart to tweak that sweet potato recipe for the air fryer for this week's AirFryDay. It's a festive snack or side dish for your own spooky party and is incredibly easy to make. Here's what you need to know.

Ingredients

2 large sweet potatoes (or as many as you want to make)

Salt, pepper, and garlic powder

Canola oil

Directions

Using a knife, cut the sweet potatoes in rounds roughly 1/4 inch thick. You want to have a bunch of sweet potato circles once finished. Using a cookie cutter shaped like a pumpkin — or other spooky shapes — press hard through each round to cut the sweet potato into shape. Coat the fries with oil, the season heavily with salt. Add a heavy pinch of pepper and garlic powder. Air fry at 400 degrees for about 15 minutes. Enjoy!

The details

This recipe is incredibly simple. With a little elbow grease, you could knock this out in roughly 25 minutes. Obviously, the most time-consuming portion of the process is shaping the fries. A few notes on that.

First: Please, please be careful while cutting the circular rounds of sweet potato. Cutting those circles can prove unstable, since the potato can roll. If necessary, slice a sliver off the bottom of the potato, which will create a flat surface.

Mashable Credit: Here's me, cutting up sweet potato with a cookie cutter.

Second: the cookie cutter. These were the cutters I bought, which came with a pumpkin, bat, ghost, and cat shape. While pumpkins make the most sense — you know, orange and all that — I loved all of the shapes, so I made all four into fries. It's really not difficult, you may just have to really push at times. If that hurts your hand, lie a dish towel over the cutter.

From there, it's just seasoning the fries and air frying. The 400-degree heat produces a blackened exterior and fluffy interior. In truth, we're just roasting cutely shaped vegetable here, but the air fryer is awesome at roasting vegetables. Here's how the final product looked.

Come on, how cute are those? Credit: Mashable

My fries took about 13 minutes to cook, but I suspect 15 minutes would be the norm for most, since my air fryer typically cooks things quickly. Basically, just check the fries to see if they get crispy and if they're fork tender.

OK, so...something to admit: The deep-fried version of this recipe tastes better. It just does. That's because deep-fried fries are perfect and delicious. The exterior of the fry gets a bit more bubbly and crisp, while the interior is light and airy. The air-fried version, meanwhile, has more of a rough and a softer interior. It's still tasty, but it's not deep-fried.

But deep frying is also less healthy, requires a lot more oil, creates a huge mess, and can be dangerous for less experienced cooks. You sure as hell aren't going to deep fry in less than 30 minutes.

Cooking pumpkin-shaped fries in the air fryer is way more practical and still quite tasty. If you're having a Halloween party, I know from experience that they'll be a hit. Give yourself a half hour, grab some dipping sauces, and you've got a real treat on your hands.

That expansive, console-sized Pokémon RPG you’ve been waiting for since you were a kid might finally be here.

Three years after Pokémon made its main series debut on the Switch with Sword and Shield, Nintendo and developer Game Freak are back with Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. It’d be easy to dismiss this as “just another Pokémon game,” as that’s pretty much what each entry has been for the last 26 years. Sure, Game Freak has fiddled with the formula a bit over time, but you usually know exactly what you’re getting into with one of these kid-friendly RPGs.

I’m happy to report that after spending a little more than an hour with Pokémon Scarlet (both games launch Nov. 18), it seems like Game Freak might have done the unthinkable and turned Pokémon into a different kind of game, with a full open world and the freedom to move around in it as you please. Moreover, it seems to have done that without ditching the adorable monster charm or deceptively deep turn-based battles the series has always had.

The 'Wild Area' goes wide

Welcome to Paldea. Credit: Nintendo

For a little over two and a half decades, Pokémon games were always refreshingly modest as RPGs go, eschewing the complex Final Fantasy-like stories about dethroning and killing gods in favor of good vibes and collecting hundreds of cute monsters.

That changed a tiny bit with 2019's Sword and Shield, which plopped a big open-world section into the middle of its otherwise linear world map called the “Wild Area.” There wasn’t a great deal to do in the Wild Area aside from hunt down and catch Pokémon, and its presence in the game was more awkward than transformative. Still, it felt like a hint of something to come. So, naturally, Game Freak turned that seed of an idea into a whole game three years later.

Pokémon Scarlet and Violet takes the open-ended nature of the Pokémon Legends: Arceus spin-off game from earlier this year and transposes it onto a more traditional series entry. Here, Nintendo and Game Freak have dispensed with Arceus' distant past setting and wild Pokémon attacks in favor of a more modern aesthetic with the typical Pokémon battle system.

Your custom character starts as a Pokémon academy student in the Spain-inspired region of Paldea and, from there, you're given free rein to explore a giant map at whatever pace you want. You’ll also get a legendary Pokémon (either Koraidon or Miraidon, depending on which game you get) who acts as a mount for your travel needs.

Game Freak might have done the unthinkable and turned Pokémon into a different kind of game. - Alex Perry

I started my demo in the large, centrally located capital city of Mesagoza, but quickly hopped on Koraidon and got to work exploring a minuscule portion of the world that the demo took place in. You can’t do much while on foot, but on your legendary mount, the world is your oyster. Traversal is nearly limitless: Miraidon and Koraidon have no stamina meter à la Breath of the Wild , so you can climb any cliff or even sprout wings and glide from any height to your heart’s content.

That freedom of movement also applies to the game’s story structure. There are three central stories to follow here. One has you hunting down mythical titan Pokémon, another has you squaring off against the adversarial Team Star, and the last is a more traditional series of gym battles to become league champion. You can apparently do these in any order you want. That said, I noticed that enemy Pokémon levels seem locked in place for different challenges, meaning you may run into something that’s too hard and have to go do something else for a while instead.

There are three stories to follow this time around. Credit: Nintendo

I found it pretty damn cool to simply get dropped into a Pokémon world with the ability to go wherever I wanted, whenever I wanted. Summoning Koraidon and sprinting across the fields and deserts of Paldea was fun in a way that exploration usually isn’t in these games. There’s a simple pleasure to climbing a tower or a mountain, and gliding through the air to a distant area — it's something that Pokémon has never had before in a main series title.

As someone who likes the Pokémon games but isn’t hardcore about them by any means, I’ve been begging for changes like this for years. For too long, the series has been stuck in its ways, holding onto linear design conventions from the Game Boy era. The fact that Scarlet and Violet seem to be genuinely different games is thrilling, but I’d also advise hardcore fans not to worry. That familiar Pokémon DNA is still present.

Still the same Pokémon where it matters most

I’d liken Scarlet and Violet to a sandwich, where the ingredients are mostly the same as they’ve always been, but the bread holding them together has been changed for variety’s sake.

In other words, while the pace at which you explore the world and the means you use to do so have been radically altered, your goals remain mostly unchanged. You’re here to discover and catch as many pocket monsters as you can, engaging in easy-to-grasp, turn-based battles along the way.

While the core gameplay loop there hasn’t changed much, the presentation has. Battles no longer whisk you away to a small arena outside of the overworld. Now they start seamlessly wherever you and the enemy Pokémon were standing without any loading. Pokémon Centers, used for healing, are now little roadside stalls placed in the open world, complete with shops and even a station for crafting new moves out of materials you get for winning fights.

The new Pokémon are adorable, as always. Credit: Nintendo

That alone has the potential to make the game grindy as hell, but you can now press a button to send a Pokémon out to auto-battle nearby enemies until its HP runs out. I found this to be an incredibly quick way to get XP and materials (even if you get more for fighting the real way), with the added benefit of being able to run around and collect any items nearby while your little homie battles away.

Aside from the new movement abilities, I’d call that the best new feature I saw in my time with Scarlet and Violet. This is very much a Pokémon game at its core, but it’s one you can now approach more casually than before. Not every wild Pokémon is worth the effort it takes to fight, but at least you can net the benefits of doing so while lazily standing by.

I love receiving rewards for doing no work.

Oh, and to bring the sandwich metaphor full circle: You can actually throw picnics for your Pokémon, complete with a physics-based sandwich-building minigame. It’s the best. I am going to spend hours and hours doing that when Pokémon Scarlet and Violet releases later this fall.

Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet come to Nintendo Switch on Nov. 18.

Your custom character starts as a Pokémon academy student in the Spain-inspired region of Paldea and, from there, you're given free rein to explore a giant map at whatever pace you want. You’ll also get a legendary Pokémon (either Koraidon or Miraidon, depending on which game you get) who acts as a mount for your travel needs.

Game Freak might have done the unthinkable and turned Pokémon into a different kind of game. - Alex Perry

I started my demo in the large, centrally located capital city of Mesagoza, but quickly hopped on Koraidon and got to work exploring a minuscule portion of the world that the demo took place in. You can’t do much while on foot, but on your legendary mount, the world is your oyster. Traversal is nearly limitless: Miraidon and Koraidon have no stamina meter à la Breath of the Wild , so you can climb any cliff or even sprout wings and glide from any height to your heart’s content.

That freedom of movement also applies to the game’s story structure. There are three central stories to follow here. One has you hunting down mythical titan Pokémon, another has you squaring off against the adversarial Team Star, and the last is a more traditional series of gym battles to become league champion. You can apparently do these in any order you want. That said, I noticed that enemy Pokémon levels seem locked in place for different challenges, meaning you may run into something that’s too hard and have to go do something else for a while instead.

There are three stories to follow this time around. Credit: Nintendo

I found it pretty damn cool to simply get dropped into a Pokémon world with the ability to go wherever I wanted, whenever I wanted. Summoning Koraidon and sprinting across the fields and deserts of Paldea was fun in a way that exploration usually isn’t in these games. There’s a simple pleasure to climbing a tower or a mountain, and gliding through the air to a distant area — it's something that Pokémon has never had before in a main series title.

As someone who likes the Pokémon games but isn’t hardcore about them by any means, I’ve been begging for changes like this for years. For too long, the series has been stuck in its ways, holding onto linear design conventions from the Game Boy era. The fact that Scarlet and Violet seem to be genuinely different games is thrilling, but I’d also advise hardcore fans not to worry. That familiar Pokémon DNA is still present.

Still the same Pokémon where it matters most

I’d liken Scarlet and Violet to a sandwich, where the ingredients are mostly the same as they’ve always been, but the bread holding them together has been changed for variety’s sake.

In other words, while the pace at which you explore the world and the means you use to do so have been radically altered, your goals remain mostly unchanged. You’re here to discover and catch as many pocket monsters as you can, engaging in easy-to-grasp, turn-based battles along the way.

While the core gameplay loop there hasn’t changed much, the presentation has. Battles no longer whisk you away to a small arena outside of the overworld. Now they start seamlessly wherever you and the enemy Pokémon were standing without any loading. Pokémon Centers, used for healing, are now little roadside stalls placed in the open world, complete with shops and even a station for crafting new moves out of materials you get for winning fights.

The new Pokémon are adorable, as always. Credit: Nintendo

That alone has the potential to make the game grindy as hell, but you can now press a button to send a Pokémon out to auto-battle nearby enemies until its HP runs out. I found this to be an incredibly quick way to get XP and materials (even if you get more for fighting the real way), with the added benefit of being able to run around and collect any items nearby while your little homie battles away.

Aside from the new movement abilities, I’d call that the best new feature I saw in my time with Scarlet and Violet. This is very much a Pokémon game at its core, but it’s one you can now approach more casually than before. Not every wild Pokémon is worth the effort it takes to fight, but at least you can net the benefits of doing so while lazily standing by.

I love receiving rewards for doing no work.

Oh, and to bring the sandwich metaphor full circle: You can actually throw picnics for your Pokémon, complete with a physics-based sandwich-building minigame. It’s the best. I am going to spend hours and hours doing that when Pokémon Scarlet and Violet releases later this fall.

Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet come to Nintendo Switch on Nov. 18.
Taylor Swift's tenth studio album Midnights just dropped, and we have to talk about the buildup. Swift's known for her conspiratorial fans and album Easter eggs, but with her latest drop she said she wasn't going to be up to her old tricks. Instead, capitalizing on her social media prowess, Swift had her fans glued to TikTok for a series of direct-to-camera posts. Still, fan speculation and conspiracy theories dominated conversation on the app, exposing even the most casual of fans to the Swiftie brain.

The Midnights promotional cycle was a testament to Swift's dedicated fan service. By connecting with her fans in the digital spaces they frequent, she not only stoked the flames of curiosity but also stayed true to her $500 million dollar brand . Swift has always been social media savvy, from the early days of her Tumblr lurking to her iconic Instagram reset pre-Reputation, but the Midnights era strategy has been more robust, spreading herself thin across TikTok, Instagram, Spotify… and Amazon Prime.

While fans were divided on whether or not Midnights was really living up to previous cycles, one thing rang true: Swift got every media platform, company, and brand on board. Below, we break down the social media impact of the Midnights era.

A timeline of Taylor Swift events

Hidden lyric Easter egg at NYU

Unbeknownst to the world, and also against Swift's own promise to defy her past as an avid Easter egg dropper, the singer's NYU 2022 commencement speech actually held the first Midnights clue: a hidden lyric from the upcoming album.

Announcement at the MTV VMAs

Swift announced Midnights at the Aug. 28 VMAs in her acceptance speech for Video of the Year for “All Too Well: The Short Film.” She wore a silver, bejeweled (eye emoji) dress that was suspiciously similar to a dress she wore in the “Look What You Made Me Do” music video. As any Swiftie knows, the VMAs are holy ground for the pop star, adding weight to her decision to announce the album there.

New social media era

Soon after, Swift posted the first Midnights images to her Instagram, including the full album art, number of tracks, and release date (no hiding it here). The caption to the post read, "Midnights, the stories of 13 sleepless nights scattered throughout my life, will be out October 21. Meet me at midnight." She followed up with several TikToks introducing fans to exclusive vinyl and album art, and weeks later, Swift finally made it back into the social media moment with a "Making of Midnights" video posted on Sept. 16. It stoked fan theories across TikTok and Twitter, and (unsurprisingly) held some album clues as well. What a lovely snowy beach!

Midnights Mayhem time

Swift's promotional cycle really started here and solidified TikTok as her Midnights base. On Sept. 21, Swift dropped the first of 13 midnight-timed videos revealing the entire tracklist, hosted by TikTok. "I know I have a habit of dropping cryptic clues and Easter eggs when giving you information about my music," Swift said in the video, "and I'm not here to deny that, but I am here to defy that." For the next 17 days, Swifties, and even casual listeners, tuned in to the app to see Swift spin a bingo cage, pull out a lucky song, and unveil the Midnight release through her vintage phone (a meta moment). The track titles were also accompanied by track explanations — a rare thing from the usually cryptic pop star.

These videos were also on Instagram, and even on YouTube Shorts, which many artists have pivoted toward to maximize the so-called demand for short-form video content.

Spotify collaborations begin

Swift's next huge social media swing was with streaming giant Spotify (a departure from Apple Music heavy Taylor's Version promo of the last two years). Swift released exclusive videos with even more information about the album, including the " 5 things that inspired Midnights " — "self-loathing, fantasizing about revenge, wondering what could have been, falling in love, and falling apart."

In the week leading up to the album, Swift then released an entire calendar of online events. At the same time, Spotify began a lyrical journey around the world, revealing select lyrics from all the Midnights songs in undisclosed locations. This effectively shifted Swift's promo over to the Twitter Swiftie-verse, within which stan accounts and Taylor Nation itself weighed in on lyric and era theories.

And even more collaborations upon collaborations

In the 24 hours before the album release, Swift asked her devoted fans to take to the field for Amazon Prime Video's Thursday Night Football (because… that makes sense), where they got the first glimpse of the album's music videos ahead of its release. She also collaborated with her old haunt Tumblr to release a custom Midnights blog theme .

And if she wasn't directly working with the brand ahead of the new music, companies sure were using the Midnights internet moment to boost their social media accounts, from Dominos UK to Auntie Anne's Pretzels .

Fans spent many sleepless nights theorizing about Midnights. Here are the speculations filling up your timeline.

Myth: There were Easter eggs being dropped this whole time…

Status: True! (duh)

Even though Swift pledged to defy her old habits this time around, Swifties were not going to let go of an opportunity to hunt for secret messages — and they were right to do so! Turns out Swift had hidden a Midnights reference as far back as her May commencement speech at NYU, and other sharp-eyed fans found vague nods to the album scattered throughout her posts and social media bios.

Myth: Each song represents a different era or previous album.

Status: Busted!

When Swift announced the album she said it was "the stories of 13 sleepless nights throughout my life." Fans speculated that each track on the album would represent a different era or previous album, potentially drawing on her large vault of unreleased tracks written over her long career. But Swift isn’t recycling old songs. In an interview with SiriusXM where she answered fan questions Swift said, "Everything on Midnights is new work. Nothing is leftover from a different album. It might have been ideas or concepts or things I’ve thought of maybe making in the past, but I didn’t write anything until I was making this album."

Myth: niceboy ed is Joe Alwyn

Status: Unconfirmed.

A couple weeks after announcing Midnights, Swift uploaded a 15-second montage of the making of the album to TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube set to the song "life you lead" by niceboy ed. Despite Swift’s assertion that she’s denying her Easter egg past, Swifties immediately jumped on her seemingly random song choice. The track was niceboy ed’s first streaming credit and had only been released the day prior, making it suspicious to her fanbase. Swifties theorized that niceboy ed is a childhood friend of Swift’s beau Joe Alwyn based on the fact Alwyn is following him on Instagram, while others thought this was a William Bowery situation where Alwyn is actually niceboy ed. Swift has yet to address her mysterious song choice.

Myth: Taylor Swift is actually releasing two albums including the "lost" album, Karma

Status: Unconfirmed, but be serious.

Take a seat, put on your tin hat, and let us fill you in on some Taylore. There is a popular conspiracy theory that there is a “lost” album which fans dubbed Karma. Therefore, when Swift announced that track 11 on Midnights was titled "Karma" all hell broke loose in the fandom.

Prior to Reputation, Swift had released an album every two years setting up her sixth album to be released in 2016. She dyed her hair platinum blonde, signaling a new era, and fans geared up for a release. But all that was thwarted by the Kim Kardashian, Kanye West, and Swift drama that resulted in Swift leaving the public eye until Reputation’s release in 2018.

Swift hinted at Karma’s existence in "The Man" music video where Swift dressed as a man pees on a wall that has the title of all her albums in graffiti…and the word "karma." Additionally, in a 2016 interview with Vogue Swift said "Karma is real." Do with that what you may, but we’d very much like to be excluded from this narrative.

Myth: The Tumblr renaissance is happening on Midnights

Status: Partially true.

The Internet's deep obsession with the so-called 2014 Tumblr resurgence also crept its way into the Midnights release, as fans theorized Swift might be bringing on fellow Tumblr musical icons. Top picks were a feature from The 1975 or Lana Del Rey, both fellow Jack Antonoff collaborators.

Fans speculated that frontman Matty Healy of The 1975 was featured based on Swift being one of the first listeners of the band's new album Being Funny in a Foreign Language (revealed in a Healy interview with Pitchfork ). But Healy immediately shut down the rumors on his burner Twitter account.

The Del Rey speculation began thanks to Swift wearing the same shirt in a photograph with Del Rey and Antonoff as in the making of Midnights video. Sadly, only one legend made it onto the album, confirmed by the reveal of "Snow On The Beach," featuring Lana Del Rey, in the last episode of Midnights Mayhem . The sad, witchy girls won.

Myth: The upside down phones in "Midnights Mayhem with Me" signifies the album's singles

Status: Partially true.

During the Midnights Mayhem releases, fans quickly spotted some unusual behavior from the carefully crafted artist, including two videos in which she held the Midnights phone upside down as she unveiled the track titles for "Anti-Hero" and "Vigilante Shit." Swifties immediately correlated this with some kind of hidden meaning, spawning several theories like a potential collaboration or a music video. Surprise, surprise: "Anti-Hero" was confirmed to be the first single and music video release from the album. And the second? "Vigilante Shit" — which is definitely one way to describe all of the sleuthing Swifties have been doing in anticipation of Midnights. But we don't know exactly what the upside down phone means as the Thursday night football teaser suggests there's more to come.
Taylor Swift's tenth studio album Midnights just dropped, and we have to talk about the buildup. Swift's known for her conspiratorial fans and album Easter eggs, but with her latest drop she said she wasn't going to be up to her old tricks. Instead, capitalizing on her social media prowess, Swift had her fans glued to TikTok for a series of direct-to-camera posts.

Cyberflashing is the act of sending non-consensual nude photos via your phone. It is an act of digital sexual violence that is often minimised through terms like "unsolicited dick pics". Dating app Bumble is trying to combat the violation on its app, while also campaigning for the act to be made illegal in the UK and U.S..

In 2019, Bumble launched its artificial intelligence tool 'Private Detector', which alerts users when they've been sent an obscene photo and automatically blurs the image.

Now, the dating app is making a version of the tool available to the wider tech community.

So, how does the tool work exactly? Well, AI detects when a lewd image has been sent. The photo is then automatically blurred and the user has the choice of viewing, deleting, or reporting the image. It was launched on both Bumble and Badoo in response to the rise of cyberflashing.

Research from a UK government report from March found that 76 percent of girls aged 12–18 had been sent unsolicited nude images of boys or men. Bumble's own research found that almost half of those aged 18–24 have received a non-consensual sexual image, with 95 percent of people under the age of 44 in England and Wales stating more should be done to stop cyberflashing.

SEE ALSO: Bumble is campaigning to make cyberflashing illegal in England and Wales

Other apps have also made moves to try to combat the rise of this act of image-based sexual violence, with OKCupid announcing in 2017 it would make all users take an anti-harassment pledge stating that they wouldn't send unsolicited nude photos on the app. More recently, Mashable has reported that Instagram is working on a feature called "Nudity protection."

Bumble has made a version of Private Detector widely available on GitHub, so that other tech companies can adapt it and make features of their own to improve safety and accountability online in the fight against abuse and harassment.

Rachel Haas, Bumble’s VP of member safety, said in a statement, "Open-sourcing this feature is about remaining firm in our conviction that everyone deserves healthy and equitable relationships, respectful interactions, and kind connections online."

Bumble has been campaigning against cyberflashing in both the U.S. and UK in recent years. In 2019, the app's founder and CEO Whitney Wolfe Herd helped pass a law in Texas (HB 2789) to make non-consensual nude images a punishable offence. In the time since then, the dating app has helped pass similar bills in Virginia (SB 493) and California (SB 53).

In England and Wales, Bumble has been campaigning for the criminalisation of cyberflashing, and in March 2022, the government announced it will become a criminal offence under new laws set to be introduced, with perpetrators facing up to two years in prison.

It's time for the wider tech community to take this violation more seriously and to do more in the fight against it.

As the leaves turn and the crisp autumn chill seeps into the air, one thing becomes crystal clear: It's Over the Garden Wall season.

Created by Patrick McHale, this 2014 Cartoon Network miniseries nabbed an Emmy award for Outstanding Animated Program, and for good reason. Throughout its 10 stunning episodes, Over the Garden Wall captivates you with two brothers' odyssey through the strangely beautiful (and beautifully strange) land known as the Unknown. There, they discover curious communities, solve pressing mysteries, and ally themselves with the most unexpected of friends. The only thing they can't seem to find is their way home.

What makes Over the Garden Wall the ideal fall watch?

Ain't that just the way. Credit: Cartoon Network

You can definitely enjoy Over the Garden Wall at any point in the year, but its palette of orange-hued trees, golden sunsets, and dark nights just hits harder in the fall. Plus, the show is the perfect combination of autumn's coziest and spookiest elements. Falling leaves, piping hot comfort food, and a whole slew of seasonal pumpkins appear alongside treacherous spirits, witches, and an encroaching entity known simply as the Beast (voiced by Samuel Ramey). When you're in the Unknown, you don't know if you're about to be comforted or creeped out — or some strange fusion of the two.

Our entry points into the Unknown are teenager Wirt (voiced by Elijah Wood) and his younger stepbrother Greg (voiced by Collin Dean). They're lost in this new world and haven't a clue how to get out. Luckily for them, the denizens of the Unknown are happy to help. Well, most of them are, anyway. A mysterious Woodsman (voiced by Christopher Lloyd) provides Wirt and Greg with shelter, while a talking bluebird named Beatrice (voiced by Melanie Lynskey) offers to take them to a wise woman named Adelaide who could bring them home. Among the rest of the Unknown's charming ensemble are a town of pumpkin people, a schoolteacher dedicated to educating animals, and a pub full of character archetypes like the Tavern Keeper, the Tailor, and the Highwayman.

While these characters know exactly where they fit into the Unknown's ecosystem, Greg and Wirt are outliers. Greg, with his cheerful disposition, is endlessly excited about discovering more of the Unknown. He'll talk to anybody, try anything. He's got a teapot on his head, a pet rock that spouts Rock Facts, and pants full of candy — he's like walking childhood whimsy.

By contrast, Wirt is a bundle of teenage angst and fried nerves. He approaches every situation with a heaping amount of trepidation. Pair that with his annoyance with Greg, and you're looking at two main characters who are excellent foils for each other. Both Greg and Wirt's reactions to being somewhere as new and bizarre as the Unknown are valid — yet neither quite understands where the other is coming from. Their resulting journey brings them together in masterful yet surprising ways. In fact, the same could be said of the rest of Over the Garden Wall.

You may think you know where a certain plot is going, but the series often plays with your expectations: A sinister old woman may not be as evil as you'd think, or a beautiful ghost may be something else entirely. What you think you see is never the full picture.

Over the Garden Wall is a beautiful, nostalgic ride with dark undertones

Even though Over the Garden Wall came out in 2014, it has a timeless quality to it. You know you're watching something that was produced in the 21st century, but it could just as easily fit into the landscape of mid-20th-century animation.

That timelessness is due in a large part to the show's gorgeous animation, which evokes hand-drawn, hand-painted styles that we rarely see in modern animation. Visual inspirations range from vintage Halloween postcards to the work of animator Max Fleischer to the 1890s board game "Game of Frog Pond." The Unknown is a beautifully crafted world that you'll want to get lost in again and again, just so you can catch all the show's lovely visual details.

Adding to Over the Garden Wall's charm is its soundtrack, a collection of folksy, jazzy songs by McHale and The Blasting Company. "Potatoes and Molasses" is a delightful earworm, while "Over the Garden Wall," performed by Jack Jones, who voices a frog in the show, has the feel of a classic love song.

The standout number is the show's title theme, "Into the Unknown," also sung by Jones. A lone piano accompanies him as he croons about the arrival of autumn and pretending dreams can come true. Like Over the Garden Wall, "Into the Unknown" is haunting yet beautiful. In listening to it, you've gained something special. But at the same time the song acknowledges a loss — of spring, of memories, of simpler times.

Much of Over the Garden Wall concerns itself with these kinds of loss. For both Greg and Wirt, this is a coming-of-age story, and therefore, involves a loss of innocence. For many of the characters they meet, this is a story about overcoming grief. The cause of much of that grief, as well as a large part of Greg and Wirt's emotional journey, is the Beast.

Antlered, wreathed in darkness, and sporting a deep, operatic voice, the Beast looms large over the woods of the Unknown. Encounters with him — and with several of the Unknown's spookier citizens — are genuinely frightening. From demonic dogs to hungry ghosts, Over the Garden Wall doesn't pull its punches with its scares. Nor does it shy away from any of the existential dread such explorations of loss can evoke. The series balances this darker, more mature content with lighthearted moments and musical bangers, ensuring that people of all ages and entertainment preferences will find something to love here.

Over the Garden Wall clocks in at ten 11-minute-long episodes, so you can binge it all the way through or spread it out and savor it. Whichever option you choose, you'll feel like you've stepped out of time and into some long-lost Halloween special.

I recommend bundling up in a blanket, grabbing a mug of tea or apple cider, and jumping right into the Unknown alongside Greg and Wirt. There's no better way to spend your fall. And that's a Rock Fact!

As the leaves turn and the crisp autumn chill seeps into the air, one thing becomes crystal clear: It's Over the Garden Wall season.

Created by Patrick McHale, this 2014 Cartoon Network miniseries nabbed an Emmy award for Outstanding Animated Program, and for good reason. Throughout its 10 stunning episodes, Over the Garden Wall captivates you with two brothers' odyssey through the strangely beautiful (and beautifully strange) land known as the Unknown. There, they discover curious communities, solve pressing mysteries, and ally themselves with the most unexpected of friends. The only thing they can't seem to find is their way home.

You can definitely enjoy Over the Garden Wall at any point in the year, but its palette of orange-hued trees, golden sunsets, and dark nights just hits harder in the fall. Plus, the show is the perfect combination of autumn's coziest and spookiest elements. Falling leaves, piping hot comfort food, and a whole slew of seasonal pumpkins appear alongside treacherous spirits, witches, and an encroaching entity known simply as the Beast (voiced by Samuel Ramey). When you're in the Unknown, you don't know if you're about to be comforted or creeped out — or some strange fusion of the two.

Our entry points into the Unknown are teenager Wirt (voiced by Elijah Wood) and his younger stepbrother Greg (voiced by Collin Dean). They're lost in this new world and haven't a clue how to get out. Luckily for them, the denizens of the Unknown are happy to help. Well, most of them are, anyway. A mysterious Woodsman (voiced by Christopher Lloyd) provides Wirt and Greg with shelter, while a talking bluebird named Beatrice (voiced by Melanie Lynskey) offers to take them to a wise woman named Adelaide who could bring them home. Among the rest of the Unknown's charming ensemble are a town of pumpkin people, a schoolteacher dedicated to educating animals, and a pub full of character archetypes like the Tavern Keeper, the Tailor, and the Highwayman.

While these characters know exactly where they fit into the Unknown's ecosystem, Greg and Wirt are outliers. Greg, with his cheerful disposition, is endlessly excited about discovering more of the Unknown. He'll talk to anybody, try anything. He's got a teapot on his head, a pet rock that spouts Rock Facts, and pants full of candy — he's like walking childhood whimsy.

By contrast, Wirt is a bundle of teenage angst and fried nerves. He approaches every situation with a heaping amount of trepidation. Pair that with his annoyance with Greg, and you're looking at two main characters who are excellent foils for each other. Both Greg and Wirt's reactions to being somewhere as new and bizarre as the Unknown are valid — yet neither quite understands where the other is coming from. Their resulting journey brings them together in masterful yet surprising ways. In fact, the same could be said of the rest of Over the Garden Wall.

You may think you know where a certain plot is going, but the series often plays with your expectations: A sinister old woman may not be as evil as you'd think, or a beautiful ghost may be something else entirely. What you think you see is never the full picture.

Even though Over the Garden Wall came out in 2014, it has a timeless quality to it. You know you're watching something that was produced in the 21st century, but it could just as easily fit into the landscape of mid-20th-century animation.

That timelessness is due in a large part to the show's gorgeous animation, which evokes hand-drawn, hand-painted styles that we rarely see in modern animation. Visual inspirations range from vintage Halloween postcards to the work of animator Max Fleischer to the 1890s board game "Game of Frog Pond." The Unknown is a beautifully crafted world that you'll want to get lost in again and again, just so you can catch all the show's lovely visual details.

Adding to Over the Garden Wall's charm is its soundtrack, a collection of folksy, jazzy songs by McHale and The Blasting Company. "Potatoes and Molasses" is a delightful earworm, while "Over the Garden Wall," performed by Jack Jones, who voices a frog in the show, has the feel of a classic love song.

Aftersun, the debut feature from writer/director Charlotte Wells, is seemingly split in two. There's the main plot: father Calum (Paul Mescal) and his daughter Sophie's (Frankie Corio) vacation to Turkey. Then there's an enigmatic framing device, which sees a grown-up Sophie (Celia Rowlson-Hall) re-examining her memories of that trip.

While adult Sophie only appears in flashes throughout Aftersun , these moments lend a layer of melancholy to the vacation scenes. Instead of a linear look at a father-daughter trip, Wells turns Aftersun into an aching encapsulation of a child's desire to truly understand their parent — and the frustration that comes with such an insurmountable task. The effective blending of the past and the future paired with Mescal and Corio's beautifully natural performances make Aftersun a movie that will stick with you long after it's done.

If you're a fan of Mescal's charming and vulnerable performance in Normal People, you will love his work in Aftersun. Playing a young father, Mescal takes on a role that is both more mature and somewhat harder to read. It's clear that Calum loves Sophie dearly, but it's also clear that there are parts of his life that he isn't quite ready to share with her yet. Throughout Aftersun, Calum remains a mysterious figure, sometimes disappearing into himself or on a night walk. A scene in which Calum tells Sophie about a pivotal childhood memory sheds some light on his occasional stand-offishness, but we never learn the entire truth.

This inscrutability is by design, as the film presents Calum through Sophie's eyes. He remains unknowable in the way that our parents and their grown-up affairs can seem unknowable at a young age. However, in Corio's hands, it's clear Sophie realizes something is up. She just isn't certain what.

Aftersun is Corio's first film role, but you wouldn't know it from the strength of her performance. She and Mescal are perfectly matched, capturing all the complexities of Sophie and Calum's relationship with ease. Corio in particular is tasked with anchoring many of Aftersun's most emotionally intense sequences, including a karaoke night that will have you curling up with anxiety. She nails every moment. Whether Sophie is tagging along with vacationing teenagers, or just wandering the resort alone, you're invested in her all the way, thanks to Corio.

Aftersun has no easy answers.

Aftersun isn't interested in laying every bit of Sophie and Calum's history bare. If you want straight-up answers, you won't get them. What you will get is a deep dive into our search for meaning in memory.

In Aftersun's most surreal sequences, adult Sophie — now the same age as Calum when they took the trip together — wanders through a crowd of dancers, trying to get a glimpse of her father through flashes of strobing lights. Elsewhere, she wakes up on her birthday and turns on the home videos she took of that long-ago vacation, poring over the footage in search of clues. Her search for meaning in the past makes us look harder as well. Is there anything we can catch about Calum that she may have missed? Or has the distortions of memory made the truth impossible to decipher?

Adding to these ideas of unreliable memory is Wells's keen direction. She establishes distance between Calum and Sophie onscreen, often filtering important moments through walls, panes of glass, or the home movies. Aural distance is created in scenes where characters' voices are lightly muffled, like when Calum takes a call in a phone booth. At other times, scenes play out in mirrors or in a camera's viewfinder, and we're reminded that we're watching a reflection of a conversation, and not the conversation itself. We experience a sense of removal, just as adult Sophie experiences a removal from her memories of the vacation. We look back with her fascinated, but unable to get closer.

A third-act dance scene where both Sophie and Calum let loose is as close to catharsis as Aftersun gets, but even then there's an accompanying sense of loss. It's perhaps the best encapsulation of the film's combination of sweetness and sadness, and it makes for a truly poignant climax.

In the end, Wells, Mescal, and Corio have created a film that is touching, tragic, and one of the best looks at the relationships between a parent and child in recent years.

Aftersun was reviewed out of the 60th New York Film Festival; it is now playing in theaters.
